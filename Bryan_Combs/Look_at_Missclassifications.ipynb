      "Australian Conservative MovementGood evening, I want to share a few words in relation to the conservative movement in Australia.   I believe the time is long over due that the forces of strong political and cultural influence be met with equal political and cultural force.  The conservative movement in the US responded to the socialist threat, and declining moral values in the 60's and 70's at a time, when I would argue, the political climate was far more hostile than it is today.  Assassination was a political tool then, and that era of such severe violence seems to have passed us thank heavens.   A prominant conservative of the time William F. Buckley Jr, responded with intellect and wit to reveal those under the spell of marxism the error of their ways. He too was called a \"Nazi\" as so many with conservative views are today.  He responded with tempered fire making it very clear to his opponent that throwing around such a slur would not he tolerated.   In Australia we're dealing with the same issues as the UK and the United States, and we're overdue to turn the tide, or at the very least create a conservative bulwark against the forces leading Australians by the strings of political correctness.  There are many that have stuck their necks out, many smaller groups forming in private.  It's time for a movement of principle, of truth, a movement that will defend the family.  It's time for the conservative to stand up and raise their voice, and perhaps we won't have to learn the hard way as countless civilisations before us have.DONE\n",

This can be broadly summarized as the (correct) belief that Trump is a clear and present danger to the republic and congress should constrain the president in any manner necessary up to and including impeachment and reform and prosecuting and reforming political and bureaucratic institutions that knowingly behaved criminally during or leading to the Trump presidency. Those in the civic camp would argue that a congressional candidate that does recognize the existential threat of a Trump presidency and campaign on their desire to impeachment is neglecting their patriotic duty at the expense of partisanship.\n",

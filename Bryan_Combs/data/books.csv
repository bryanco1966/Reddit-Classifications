&gt;  It’s a culinary catalyst, an agent of change, a gastronomic rock star. Ubiquitous in the world’s most fabulous cuisines, butter is boss. Here, it finally gets its due.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;After traveling across three continents to stalk the modern story of butter, award-winning food writer and former pastry chef Elaine Khosrova serves up a story as rich, textured, and culturally relevant as butter itself.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;From its humble agrarian origins to its present-day artisanal glory, butter has a fascinating story to tell, and Khosrova is the perfect person to tell it. With tales about the ancient butter bogs of Ireland, the pleasure dairies of France, and the sacred butter sculptures of Tibet, Khosrova details butter’s role in history, politics, economics, nutrition, and even spirituality and art. Readers will also find the essential collection of core butter recipes, including beurre manié, croissants, pâte brisée, and the only buttercream frosting anyone will ever need, as well as practical how-tos for making various types of butter at home--or shopping for the best.

Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

&amp;#x200B;

If you recall, a couple months ago I made a post about my school not having a library. The response from you all was amazing- I received an outpouring of generosity and donations, both in a normative sense, and in boxes and boxes of used books.

I love those books; the dog eared pages, scribbled notes in the margins, and ancient library stamps.  They bring history and character to my classroom, and my children know that real people somewhere cared enough to send them books, and their own books at that.  In addition to these well loved, amazing books, your donations allowed me to order an entire classroom set of novels, over 75 different books that range over so many different topics and areas of the literary world.

In an effort to keep this short, thank you.  Thank you a million times over and from the bottom of my heart.

Just finished the last page of The Last Wild Men of Borneo and was sorry to. Such a fine book, but I was most impressed with your 18-day trek with the Penan. That is really deep diving into your subject material that few writers, maybe Sebastian Junger, would undertake. In my younger days as a hard rock exploration geologist I spent a lot of summers in the remote wilds of Northern British Columbia, hiking all day through Devil's Club and thick woods but then of course at the end of the traverse, a chopper would drop out of the sky and take us back to camp for dinner and a beer.

Anyways, I enjoyed Savage Harvest a lot and Wild Men too. Your books make for fine reading.

Dear Oolican,

Thanks so much for your note, and for reading both Wild Men and SH. What I kept thinking during that time with the Penan was that Bruno had done that, lived that, for six years. You get used to conditions that you'd never tolerate at home, of course, fairly quickly, too, but still. Of course, Bruno did go frequently into Long Seridan and other villages, where creature comforts lay, but less and less as time passed and the pressure to capture him grew. Hard to imagine. As for me, yes, I thought about that dinner and that beer just as much as you. 

Anyway, thanks again for your gracious words. 

Best,
Carl ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Hoffman,&lt;/p&gt;

He is approached by a strange man who seemingly attacks him in his home but really is installing a device in him that activates once a ferox enters earths realm and gives him super strength that feeds off what he already is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a big catch though and I won&amp;#39;t spoil it incase anybody sees this and wants to read the book but he courageously alienates his friends and family and turns himself into a weapon to save humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a ton of twist and turns along the way. T.Ellery Hodge tells a beautiful story about an unassuming boy becoming a man and battling his inner self all along the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a trilogy only book 1 and 2 are out currently but 3 should be coming soon I hope! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve read it lets talk about it! &lt;/p&gt;

There's an author. She's not my favorite author, but she writes solid books with good plots and fantastic dialogue. Really excellent.

Thing is, she just started a spin-off series from her main series. One of the bad guys from the main series is now the protagonist. And I was like... but the things he did in the book are sadistic and unforgiveable, how is he the protagonist now? But whatever, I'll try to give it a chance, I guess?

I start reading it and he gets given a blanket absolution, oh, all the terrible things he did was someone else's fault, there was magic involved, now that magic is gone and left to his own devices he'll be way less evil. Okay, whatever. A little hand-wavy, not sure why you needed to make a story about this guy and then whitewash his past, there were plenty of other dark anti-heroes you could have made the star, but you went with this guy. Fine.

I'm about a third of the way through the book and I can't go any farther. He just got way, way too rapey. This was my first red flag when I first learned he was getting his own book; I've got nothing against dark situations, there's a lot of murder and death in these books, people struggling with how much they love to fight, but this guy always stood out cuz he was creepy af. He got actual sexual thrill from combat, and was frequently shown objectifying women. It was almost enough that I wasn't gonna give the book a chance, at all.

Early in the book, to my pleasant surprise, he notices a woman noticing him, approaches and flirts with her, is given a solid no, and he simply moves on. I was like, okay. I'm not cool with how you were in the past, but whatever. I guess you're just magically someone else now.

This proved to be wishful thinking. I don't wanna spoil anything just in case, but about a third of the way through the book there's a tense argument scene and he seamlessly slips into fantasizing about raping the woman he's arguing with. I sucked it up and read exactly two more paragraphs to see if some explanation came up, if it was some throwback from his past and he was going to react with revulsion to his own dark impulses, if they were going to acknowledge at all that this was a bad idea... nope. Totally natural. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen. Getting hard thinking about how delicious it will be when she tries to fight him off.

I get that the author was going for ""anti-hero."" I'm not unaware of the attempt. But no. Someone at some level in the proof-reading process should have told her that this is not how you anti-hero. Honestly someone should have told her that she burned her bridge with him as a bad guy and not to even try, but literally everyone from her beta readers to her editors who read the rape-fantasy scene and told her ""good job"" failed her.

Maybe I'm over-reacting. Maybe I should have just trusted my instincts and never read this book at all. I feel like now I can't even go back to the main series and re-read it. No part of this is okay at all. Maybe I'm just not dark enough, maybe the problem is with me, but I can't empathize with a main character who thinks it's a good thing to fantasize about rape.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this isn&amp;#39;t the place for this.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you read a lot of reviews before picking a book? After reading it? Do you do book clubs? Are you a celebrity reviewer? I basically just use it to catalog and rate without a review, just to kind of document for myself. I've been thinking about doing reviews but every time I write one I feel like my opinion really isn't that important and there's a lot more well-read people who know about literary theory and things like that.

“Characters Victor: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

Martin’s development of the main character Dunk as an imperfect protagonist wins this category. Before reading the book, I though Dunk and Egg as names for the main characters might make Martin’s whole story a joke. Luckily, I was wrong. Dunk’s attempts to do his best in the world make for better character development than the almost all-powerful Geralt of Rivia. The Last Wish is supposed to be an introduction to Geralt, which it does serve for the basics that Geralt is a Witcher. He’s dangerous, imperfect, and he tries to do his best in the world, but this doesn’t compare to the growth we’re able to enjoy in Dunk’s and Egg’s adventures. The humor Sapkowski places into The Last Wish does add significantly to it and is one of the main reasons I enjoy the stories of Geralt so much.
Plot Victor: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

Martin’s stories provide a better arc to enjoy than Sapkowski’s disjointed and unconnected stories. While Martin has three longer stories, Sapkowski’s is a collection of six stories with a frame story that’s utilized between each of the six stories. A collection of short stories is fine to be disjointed, but the opportunity to use the frame to help the reader wasn’t utilized to its full potential and that penalizes Sapkowski in my review. Sapkowski’s challenge to write about the one main character that needs to fit in the rest of stories is more difficult. Meanwhile, Martin’s characters are never seen again in his books. Additionally, The Last Wish was written before most of Sapkowski’s other works, likely before he could have known the entire saga he was about to write.
Connections Victor: The Last Wish.

Sapskowski paints the scenes for some of the fundamental lore for the rest of his books and CDPR’s games. In comparison, Martin throws a lot of lineage at the reader and not much else in significant connections. The lightbulb moments that went off for me while reading The Last Wish were substantial and I don’t see even a thoroughly knowledgeable fan of Martin’s world to feel nearly the satisfaction of revelations that Sapkowski provided.

...

Final Verdict: If you’ve never read, watched, or played any media in either writer’s worlds, read The Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. It’ll provide a short, fun, and satisfying read. Plus there are some illustrations to enjoy throughout the book. “

Only after getting the help of another writer, Terry Bison did the book actually get completed. And it's a fantastic book on its own, even rivaling it. But that's the problem. It has to be compared to its original.

I feel as if this book was written first, or even another book set within the world that Miller crafted, we would have a while series crafted in this fictional universe. Because that is exactly what Miller created, a *universe*. A world where knowledge is sacred and is used for evil and for good. It is sad that we will never see that world again. And it makes me sad every time I see it on my shelf. I'd love to dive into a post apocalypse that started back at 0 that was driven by the church. 

To anyone who had read the original, I highly suggest the sequel. It took me three times to actually get through it.

Only after getting the help of another writer, Terry Bison did the book actually get completed. And it&amp;#39;s a fantastic book on its own, even rivaling it. But that&amp;#39;s the problem. It has to be compared to its original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as if this book was written first, or even another book set within the world that Miller crafted, we would have a while series crafted in this fictional universe. Because that is exactly what Miller created, a &lt;em&gt;universe&lt;/em&gt;. A world where knowledge is sacred and is used for evil and for good. It is sad that we will never see that world again. And it makes me sad every time I see it on my shelf. I&amp;#39;d love to dive into a post apocalypse that started back at 0 that was driven by the church. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To anyone who had read the original, I highly suggest the sequel. It took me three times to actually get through it. Mostly due to having to stop and search things up as it deals heavily with how the church works, monks work and nomadic culture. Fictional or not. &lt;/p&gt;

1. Read out loud


2. Read slowly

3.reread a page or chapter as much as you need to.


4. Keep reading even if its not making sense or you aren't retaining it.


5. Try audible it's not cheating. 

I'm 33 years old and I hadn't read a single book (aside from a DMV handbook) in 15 years since I had left highschool. My excuse was always ""I can't retain anything"" and it was true. I could read a whole page and be into what I was reading and as soon as I was done with the page I had already forgot what I had read. I just keep telling myself reading isn't for me. And I went 15 years without reading a book. 

Then one day I kept hearing about this new book and how amazing it was! I knew I couldn't read it but I had to know the story so I broke and got myself and audible account. I bought the book and loved it! All of a sudden I wanted more! I wanted to listen to another book but they aren't cheap on audible and I couldn't wait a whole month for my next credit. I went down to my local thrift store and they had books for just ¢.75! I grabbed one and took it home. I immediately ran into the same problem as before I couldn't retain anything and it nearly broke me. But then I thought to myself why can you listen to a book but not read it? So what I did is I decided to read it outloud to myself as if I was listening to it in audible and that helped a bit.

After finding out that reading out loud worked for me I also realized that reading very slowly also helped. I was finally able to make progress on my book. I did have to go back and re-read a few chapters a few times just to make sure I truly retained what I had just read. Another thing I found out that worked for me was pushing through with any book that I picked up. No matter how stupid I felt not understanding what was going on or even if I didn't understand certain words. I realized that just reading on that a lot of it would just come together and make sense. And after getting through difficult books later on other books would seem like a breeze. 

A year and a half and 20 books later I no longer have to read out loud or very slowly. I just pick up a book and read it. Reading is for me now and I love it. It's my biggest pastime and I'm glad I stuck with it!

Finally, instead of leaving EFL and **getting a real job**, as various people along the way suggested I do, I got a three-book deal with the Orion Publishing Group, a movie deal with Silver Pictures and Warner Brothers and the dissolute bohemian life of a full-time writer. Invitations to work in related fields like comics, gaming, movies and TV started to crop up shortly thereafter, and I try to keep my hand in at all of those too. I still don’t have a real job, and if I’ve sorted out my life to any extent, it rarely feels like it. As the great Joe Walsh says, **I can’t complain but sometimes I still do**.

I have always wanted to read American Psycho, as satire tends to be my favorite type of novel, but was always a little nervous about how violent the book is supposed to be, so I avoided it.

Last week I saw an old interview with Mary Harron and Bret Easton Ellis where Harron jokes about how the novel only has about six pages of violence in it, so I thought what the hell and gave it a shot.

Just finished it today, and I'm glad I read it. I really enjoyed the writing style, and Bateman's narration has really stuck with me the last few days as I was reading. I was able to pretty easily skip some of the more disgusting parts of the novel without missing much, and Harron was right, there isn't THAT much violence in the book, as it seems to come in short, ridiculously over the top, bursts.

The book was honestly pretty hilarious, and I enjoyed the biting commentary. Every time he randomly interjected with what had been featured on The Patty Winters Show, or talk about his Platinum AmEx I would often laugh out loud. 

If anything, I feel like the book could have been maybe 50-100 pages shorter. While I loved the repetitive ramblings about fashion or restaurants or music, it went just past the point of enjoyable into skimmable toward the end.

I think my biggest question is, why did BEE write such violent scenes into a novel that I think otherwise got its points across pretty successfully?

Yesterday I finished a book titled ""Munmun"" recommended to our class by the local teen librarian.  She does book talks twice a year and usually I love every book she recommends so of course I decided to check this out.

I knew right away from reading the book jacket it would be an interesting read.

Because this book is largely a commentary on wealth inequality and capitalism is written from the perspective of an extremely poor and illiterate person, it is also written in the tone of an illiterate person.  Forexample, alot of short phrases are cominbed, sentences are very runon, things ramble, jumpy and see what I mean?  This style takes a lot of getting used to, but is so beautifully and consistently done that it pulls you even deeper into the world of the book.  The only other book that's even come close to doing something this unique was ""Ivory and Bone"" which was written almost entirely in 2nd person. 

As far as the actually story, the book jacket and online basic summaries are also a little mislrading.  They portray it as a story about a littlepoor brother and sister working to get our of their impoverished state.  You would imagine the climax then to be their success and for a happy ended.  Rather, their success comes about 1/3 of the way through the book (sort of, it's a complicated book, you should read it to understand it more fully).  The book is more about the main character Warner struggling with the economic and social systems present in the book regardless of what scale he's at (scale is the book's representation of weath.  The more munmuns you have, the larger you physically are and the bigger your scale).  It's a beautiful commentary/satire, beautiful story, and the most unique read I've had in a very long time.  

I created this post as a thread to hear other opinions about the book from people who've read it.  What did you think of the writing style?  Did you enjoy this story?  I'm just so exacted about the book, I really want to talk about it.

I just finished East of Eden then watched the film. Now I have a strong urge to write the director and ask him what we did to deserve such an atrocity. How can such a complex book with such diverse characters be cut so short? 

Raise your hand if you've been personally victimized by Elia Kazan and James Dean. 

No Lee! No Sam Hamilton! No context with regards to Adam or Cate which inadvertently shaped who they were as people and as parents.

I understand books have to be adapted to film and some things don't translate well but there were a few parts of the novel I was shocked didn't make the cut. Given that the film only covers the 4th part of the book - the real travesty - I figured less deviations would take place. 

For example, I was disappointed that Cal and Adam didn't have a genuine father - son conversation. It's a pivotal point in the book as Adam finally realizes that he isn't any better of a father than his own. He then makes a choice to be a better Father and recognize Cal as not only his son, but a person. In one conversation Adam realizes he wants to know his sons and Cal realizes he loves his father. It was wholesome and I was sad to see it cut but the movie did try and make up for what it lacked.

In the book Steinbeck meticulously crafted his characters but since the movie skipped the first 500 pages it was necessary to create a few scenes. Doing this gave the audience some context of who the characters were and who they wished to be. 

I think the scene with the German neighbor did just this and added a lot to the movie that viewers needed in order to understand the boys characters. In it Aron protected his neighbor as he couldn't understand or accept that people could be so cruel and unjust. Cal jumped out of a ferris wheel to protect his brother because he thought it was good and his guilt guided him. However, Aron chastised Cal for doing this because it was self indulgent of Cal. That rejection made Cal 'bad' which Abra was attracted to because it meant she didn't have to live up to Arons seemingly pretentious 'goodness' which was another rejection, only towards Aron, not Cal. So much in one scene.

If only people watching the movie knew how similar Adam was to Aron. Adam, in his naivety, refused to see bad (specifically in Kate which his talks about with Lee and Sam) but Aron refused to accept bad and it's existence hurt him. However, with age Adam began to see the bad and he felt guiltily for loving Kate. This changed him and he couldn't accept Cals money - surprise, another rejection.

Another part the movie messed up was how Cal saw Cathy. He knew she was missing the ability to see good just as Adam did when he brought her Charles's letter. My mouth fell open when Kate gave Cal money instead of Lee. It was against everything she was because she hated Cal. He saw her insecurities, her fear, her inability to believe people can be good and she hated it.

With this in mind, the story is very well done. In the 660-page tome, Tyson offers his version of the biography of Lovecraft’s legendary Abdul Alhazred, the author of the Necronomicon frequently referenced in the mythos. Late in the text Tyson separates the two names when the title character reveals his name to be Alhazred, but that it had previously been Abdul. This explanation is essential in my view, since the original Lovecraftian name is grammatically incorrect.

The story begins quickly. By the end of the first chapter the main character is mutilated, made a eunuch, forced to consume his own genitals. As the story proceeds he meets various spirits, demons, sorceresses, ghouls, and Cthulhu spawn as he seeks magical knowledge and the power to restore his lost manhood. The story in many ways follows the pattern of mythical coming of age stories for both Alhazred and his young female companion. Here are a few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the book:

•	Early in the story Alhazred is marked with the sign of the outer god Nyalarthotep, a notably dishonorable diety who disdains the other outer gods. While the sign grants him safe passage in many cases, many of the characters in the story recognize it as a kind of brand, marking him as the god’s slave. As a result they are distrustful of Alhazred as they are of Nyalarthotep.

•	Following his banishment to the desert Alhazred joins a clan of ghouls, eventually being accepted by them. It’s at this point that he develops the first and strongest friendship of his life with a ghoul who has himself been banished. The friendship creates lasting change in Alhazred, leading him to embrace his new identity.

•	May of the longest-lived, most intelligent characters in the novel often have only one critical piece of wisdom or knowledge, but turn out to be tricksters or fools in every other way.

•	Chapter 52 is one of the strangest pieces of fiction I’ve ever read.  The book is worth reading just for that chapter.

•	The story begins with Alhazred’s manhood being torn from him by a king, and he fully recovers himself by defeating another king. In the process of seeking the power to restore his manhood, he discovers a more powerful and free version of himself.

The novel is broken into two parts of approximately equal length. The first part describes Alhazred’s journey through the desert of Yemen, across the Red Sea, and up the Nile. The second part details the trek of he and his female companion into Mesopotamia and finally Damascus. The storytelling in part one is well focused. Part two has less focus in the narrative; it can be better described as a series of vignettes and adventures. Tyson incorporates plot twists throughout the novel, but some come off as gimmicks rather than solid storytelling. I found Alhazred to be a fun read, though it only scratches the surface of the Lovecraft mythos. It also contains themes of hope and agency that aren’t found in Lovecraft’s work. I’d recommend this book to folks who are interested in occult fiction, Lovecraft-inspired fiction and the Cthulhu mythos, or weird fantasy in general.

Admittedly I was turned off as it sounded like a less interesting ripoff of Stephen King's apocalyptic epic *The Stand*.

​

But after being unable to settle on a new book to start, I picked *Swan Song* up albeit skeptical of the product. Boy was I wrong. I couldn't put the damn thing down and despite it's size finished it off in a few weeks. Yes, it shares some thematic and conceptual elements of *The Stand* but that's where the similarities really stop. I have to admit I lean towards liking McCammon's work better.

​

Both stories have an apocalyptic event kick starting an epic battle of good and evil in the ruins of America. While I enjoyed the superflu aspect in *The Stand's* first half, McCammon really captures the devastation, confusion, and fear that comes with nuclear war. McCammon's post-disaster villain ""The Man with the Scarlet Eye"" also comes off more menacing than Randall Flagg because he's almost a Lovecraftian unspeakably horrific entity. Whereas *The Stand* establishes the main conflict as a battle in a Judeo-Christian religious terms, *Swan Song* sets it in more magical and mysterious tones.   I'd also give points to the characters of *Swan Song* who by the end I was really rooting for and understood even if they were villainous.

Yes, it shares some thematic and conceptual elements of &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt; but that&amp;#39;s where the similarities really stop. I have to admit I lean towards liking McCammon&amp;#39;s work better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both stories have an apocalyptic event kick starting an epic battle of good and evil in the ruins of America. While I enjoyed the superflu aspect in &lt;em&gt;The Stand&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; first half, McCammon really captures the devastation, confusion, and fear that comes with nuclear war. McCammon&amp;#39;s post-disaster villain &amp;quot;The Man with the Scarlet Eye&amp;quot; also comes off more menacing than Randall Flagg because he&amp;#39;s almost a Lovecraftian unspeakably horrific entity. Whereas &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt; establishes the main conflict as a battle in a Judeo-Christian religious terms, &lt;em&gt;Swan Song&lt;/em&gt; sets it in more magical and mysterious tones.   I&amp;#39;d also give points to the characters of &lt;em&gt;Swan Song&lt;/em&gt; who by the end I was really rooting for and understood even if they were villainous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could talk all day here but I was curious if anyone here had read both these books. I&amp;#39;d love to hear your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

As is true for many authors who were successful in the pulp fiction industry Merritt’s plots and charac-ters were often formulaic. However, Merritt integrated enough unique premises and ideas to make each of his works unique and entertaining.

The most heavily printed version of the story includes the original novelette plus the concluding sequel, The Snake Mother. However, because the story was reprinted so many times several differing versions can be found in pulp magazines and books emerging from 1930 through 1980, with introductory chapters being the most frequent addition to the story.

The hero and main character of The Face in the Abyss, Nicholas Graydon, is in many ways a stock character of the pulp era. A reasonably well edu-cated white American male, thirsty for adventure and wealth, quick tempered, physically courageous though possessing a simplistic conscience, and of course having a strong attraction to young women.

The story opens with Graydon, a mining engineer, being recruited by three treasure hunters to seek Incan treasure. One of the treasure hunters takes a young Incan woman hostage. He attempts to assault her but is stopped by Graydon, who sets the young woman free. The others return and become incensed that what the girl, whom they saw as a ticket to fabulous wealth, was freed. They disarm Graydon of his “automatic” and make him a prisoner during their search for treasure. The woman eventually returns with others from her society, and in a twist, leads the men to a hidden city where they find a trove of gold and jewels. However, the horde of wealth turns out to be under the control of an apparitional dark lord called Namir. The rest of the novel centers on Graydon’s recruitment into a battle against Namir and his allies. A few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the novel are below:

•	While many pulp-era stories contain unabashed casual racism and sexism, it’s not blatantly on display in the Face in the Abyss. In fact, one of the strongest leaders in the story, the Snake Mother, is female.

The Face in the Abyss is a fun read, and gives the reader a few interesting tidbits to think about. Just as importantly, it gives the reader a window into the mindset of many males in 1920s America.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham Merritt’s “The Face in the Abyss” was one of the most heavily read and reprinted novels of the pulp era. As is true for many authors who were successful in the pulp fiction industry Merritt’s plots and charac-ters were often formulaic. However, Merritt integrated enough unique premises and ideas to make each of his works unique and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most heavily printed version of the story includes the original novelette plus the concluding sequel, The Snake Mother. However, because the story was reprinted so many times several differing versions can be found in pulp magazines and books emerging from 1930 through 1980, with introductory chapters being the most frequent addition to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hero and main character of The Face in the Abyss, Nicholas Graydon, is in many ways a stock character of the pulp era. A reasonably well edu-cated white American male, thirsty for adventure and wealth, quick tempered, physically courageous though possessing a simplistic conscience, and of course having a strong attraction to young women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens with Graydon, a mining engineer, being recruited by three treasure hunters to seek Incan treasure. One of the treasure hunters takes a young Incan woman hostage. He attempts to assault her but is stopped by Graydon, who sets the young woman free. The others return and become incensed that what the girl, whom they saw as a ticket to fabulous wealth, was freed. They disarm Graydon of his “automatic” and make him a prisoner during their search for treasure. The woman eventually returns with others from her society, and in a twist, leads the men to a hidden city where they find a trove of gold and jewels. However, the horde of wealth turns out to be under the control of an apparitional dark lord called Namir. The rest of the novel centers on Graydon’s recruitment into a battle against Namir and his allies. A few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the novel are below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• While many pulp-era stories contain unabashed casual racism and sexism, it’s not blatantly on display in the Face in the Abyss. In fact, one of the strongest leaders in the story, the Snake Mother, is female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• In the story the overriding desire for money and wealth is used to bring characters to destruction, while motivations like love or knowledge lead to salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• In one of the most interesting chapters of the novel the Snake Mother discusses the similarities between those who are cer-tain there is extraterrestrial life and those who are certain there is life after death. She points out that both sets of believers have powerful arguments but no evidence, and the irony that they often reject each oth-er’s arguments. In this respect not much has changed since 1930.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The name of the ancient city in the story, Yu-Atlanchi, sounds too similar to New Atlantis to be coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

From what I have seen so far, she had a really fucked up situation growing up. Steve Jobs, while being a millionaire tech celebrity, denied that he was Lisa's father and she and her mother had to live off of welfare. When it was finally proved via DNA test that he was the father, he still denied it and in a Time magazine article said something like 10% of American men could be her father. 

From what I saw in the movies, he seemed to actively engage in gaslighting her Mom, threatening that he has people who can kill her in and instant and he could get away with it. This was only in the movie and not in Walter Issacson's book, but the people who worked on the movie did some very heavy research, even reaching out to Lisa herself, and pretty much everyone who knows Steve said that the movie was a very accurate representation of his character. 

Lisa's Mom seemed to have her own demons too. There wasn't too many details in this situation, but when she was a kid, there was an incident and she wanted to move out her Mom's house and into Steve's. 

Steve says he's remorseful for what he did. But it seems like things weren't happily ever after, and accepted her into her life (though the movie heavily implied that he didn't actually start paying decent child support until he found out she was actually a pretty intelligent person. That he may not have paid more if she seemed normal to him). They still seemed to have conflict, stemming from Lisa growing older and figuring out what Steve had done to her and her Mom. Steve at one point refused to pay Lisa's Harvard tuition. 

In the movie, both Joanna Hoffman and Andy Hertzfeld confronted Steve on the way he treated his daughter. At one point Andy tell's Steve on why he paid her tuition ""I think it's a miracle she's not robbing banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army. There's no reason in the world why she should be nice. But she is. So I helped, because somebody had to.""

I'm just worried that when I finish the book that I will forget all of the important material about him and other people I'm reading on.

This isn't a problem with novels because I read them just to enjoy it, but it might be a problem with this :(

But why is this so rare? Do books targeted at adults take themselves too seriously? Why do books fall behind in playing with our surreal  imagination relative to other forms of media? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any books that could scratch this goofy itch, feel free to list them.&lt;/p&gt;

It tells the story of her survival through the years of the communist revolution and subsequent genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge. While it's written in the first person from the perspective of a five to eight year old child, Vaddey uses the medium to work through her adult thoughts, feelings, and perspectives by placing them into the mind of her main character. A few thoughts I had while reading through the novel:

* The first chapter gives an clear description of her rather sheltered, seemingly innocent life as a member of a royal family. Her father, who works as an intellectual and a poet, seems to carry his own innocence, or perhaps naivete about the society in which he lives
* &gt;!The family's innocence is shattered by the middle of the second chapter!&lt;
* As the family flees fighting in the city and enters the countryside, with revolutionary soldiers as guides one begins to get the feeling that the entire battle for the city and refugee crisis was staged by the Khmer Rouge. The population, particularly the upper class population was tricked into moving into rural camps where they could by physically imprisoned, surveilled, and moved around with ease. 
* It's not for several months before the characters realize they won't be able to return home, and accept the reality of that situation. This meshes with the refugee experiences of other works I have read, notably ""Nobody Waiting"". It seems many people are susceptible to a belief that returning home (possibly returning to youth and perceived safety) is always possible. Even at the end of the story the girl needs to be reminded that there is no home to return to.
* Class consciousness is tied into the novel, as one would expect of a tale that dealing with communism and royalty. And it seems that lack of class mobility reduced the ability of the characters to adapt as the traditional systems by which they had defined themselves were demolished. &gt;!The most adaptable character in the story was the mother, and she had lived as a poor farmer, a villager, and a wife to a prince. Because of this she had skills as diverse as gardening, sewing, the ability to speak French, understanding of literature, an ability to keep secrets, particularly within herself. It's this skill set that becomes more important to survival than all others.!&lt;
* &gt;!Vaddey reveals in the novel that her father had supported many of the ideals of the revolutionaries, but believed they should have worked through the democratic system that existed in Cambodia from 1970 to 1975. He states that he became disillusioned when the revolutionaries embraced authoritarianism and violence, as though their ends could justify any means. However, his response to their imminent threat was to condemn their methods in private conversation, not to demonstrate for democracy, prepare for fighting and survival, or to confront the threat in any meaningful way. Clearly he was not alone in this!&lt;; Cambodia's collapse into totalitarianism and racial genocide was the result of a massive collective error by millions of adult Cambodians, people whose very lives, and much of the meaning of their lives, depended on their social systems and structures. By failing to defend that system they became participants in their own doom.

I found the novel to be easy to read and though provoking.  Vaddey's descriptions are vivid, and her storytelling is powerful. I recommend it to anyone interested in a story of survival under terrifying conditions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Shadow of the Banyan is part memoir, part autobiographical novel of Vaddey Ratner, the daughter of a Cambodian Prince.

&lt;li&gt;The first chapter gives an clear description of her rather sheltered, seemingly innocent life as a member of a royal family. Her father, who works as an intellectual and a poet, seems to carry his own innocence, or perhaps naivete about the society in which he lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The family&amp;#39;s innocence is shattered by the middle of the second chapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the family flees fighting in the city and enters the countryside, with revolutionary soldiers as guides one begins to get the feeling that the entire battle for the city and refugee crisis was staged by the Khmer Rouge. The population, particularly the upper class population was tricked into moving into rural camps where they could by physically imprisoned, surveilled, and moved around with ease. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s not for several months before the characters realize they won&amp;#39;t be able to return home, and accept the reality of that situation. This meshes with the refugee experiences of other works I have read, notably &amp;quot;Nobody Waiting&amp;quot;. It seems many people are susceptible to a belief that returning home (possibly returning to youth and perceived safety) is always possible. Even at the end of the story the girl needs to be reminded that there is no home to return to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class consciousness is tied into the novel, as one would expect of a tale that dealing with communism and royalty. And it seems that lack of class mobility reduced the ability of the characters to adapt as the traditional systems by which they had defined themselves were demolished. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The most adaptable character in the story was the mother, and she had lived as a poor farmer, a villager, and a wife to a prince. Because of this she had skills as diverse as gardening, sewing, the ability to speak French, understanding of literature, an ability to keep secrets, particularly within herself. It&amp;#39;s this skill set that becomes more important to survival than all others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Vaddey reveals in the novel that her father had supported many of the ideals of the revolutionaries, but believed they should have worked through the democratic system that existed in Cambodia from 1970 to 1975. He states that he became disillusioned when the revolutionaries embraced authoritarianism and violence, as though their ends could justify any means. However, his response to their imminent threat was to condemn their methods in private conversation, not to demonstrate for democracy, prepare for fighting and survival, or to confront the threat in any meaningful way. Clearly he was not alone in this&lt;/span&gt;; Cambodia&amp;#39;s collapse into totalitarianism and racial genocide was the result of a massive collective error by millions of adult Cambodians, people whose very lives, and much of the meaning of their lives, depended on their social systems and structures. By failing to defend that system they became participants in their own doom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the novel to be easy to read and though provoking.  Vaddey&amp;#39;s descriptions are vivid, and her storytelling is powerful. I recommend it to anyone interested in a story of survival under terrifying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

If anything, Ged would become a wise yet mysterious wizard who accompanies the other younger protagonist throughout their journey, helping to guide them; and then when you got to book 1, you would get the rewarding backstory to Ged.

Anyway I just finished 1984 for the first time. Mandatory mention that it is in fact amazing.

But something is really bothering me about the plot, hope someone can ease those worries.

Why the hell does O'brien use SEVEN years doing a sting operation against Winston? Or simply why is Winston special at all? The society seems to have no qualms about vaporizing thought criminals after a single allegation, so why is Winston allowed to be an adulterer and enemy of the Party for so long?

Why bother with the pretense, the book and everything? Does everyone get this treatment? For sure this doesn't apply to Mr. Parson.

The only theory I have is that they want to build Winston up before brainwashing him. It still it seems very excessive and an unreasonable amount of resources must have been used on the operation.

I was reading the post on books that people had given up before finishing and I had a few in mind. I realized that most of them were what I refer to as “Book Club” books. It used to be easy to spot them before the near downfall of physical bookstores but I’m sure that Amazon and other sites still promote them. I’m talking about the books that are usually farmed out to a big publisher’s subsidiary to make them seem less big business. They usually have a visually stimulating cover that’s different from a mass market book: lots of colors and hand drawn images. Often they will have a little symbol showing that they are part of Oprah’s book club, or won some obscure award, or lacking that sport a quote from a famous author extolling their virtues, or at worst say “the author of XY” even if you’ve never heard of XY before. 

They often have reviews saying that they are the “next great American novel” or more probably paid or quid pro quo-ed glowing reviews by more successful authors on the back or even on a display sign in a bookstore. If you’re a lover of books it’s often easy to get pulled in by such an obvious yet supposedly organic marketing campaign. These books are MORE than just a book you can pick up from the bestseller rack of pulp paperbacks. This is literature so you can feel like you are bettering yourself and feel smart when you bring them up to like minded people. 

The problem is a rather large number of them just suck. Now not all of them do. I have read some that I’d put in this category that were fine, some even pretty good. But many in my experience are just part of a simple yet effective marketing strategy as I said above.

One of the worst offenders that comes to my mind immediately is Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugeniedes. I think it actually WAS an Oprah book(I didn’t watch her show) about a young person in Detroit that was born a hermaphrodite. I guess it follows their struggle to find themselves with a bit of Detroit riots thrown in? I’m not really sure...it was long as hell and didn’t seem to have much of a point. Other examples off the top of my head are Life of Pi, at least two books by Jonathan Franzen, The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton, the Kite Runner, and many, many more. I’m not saying that all of these books are bad, and I have to think that some people must like them. I’ve just been burned too many times by pretentious crap that IMO most people buy strictly so they can talk about them in a book club or to make themselves feel smart and well read. They also often focus on another culture or sexuality/lifestyles than what is perceived as the norm so that’s another feather in the cap for some I’m sure. 

So does my thesis have any merit? Do y’all like these books more often than I do? Are you ever taken in by marketing only to find you’ve bought a book that isn’t great? If you’re in a book club does it include a lot of “modern prestige literature” or books that everyone likes? Am I just a tremendous snob? Love to hear opinions on books that fall into my category and about particular books you loved or hated. I might be convinced to try one if the argument is good. 

WaaaayTLDR: I think that the publishing industry puts out a certain type of book and markets them as better than just a bestselling paperback even if they aren’t that good.

So my question is, should I read the other Smiley books first? I’ve read that this one is both a prequel and a sequel to those books so I’m unsure of where to begin. I’m very wary of spoilers so researching makes it pretty hard so I thought I’d ask here.

Does this one spoil things from the other books? Will I even be able to understand what’s going on? Will I be able to enjoy this book on its own terms?

If not, what George Smiley books do I need to read first? All of them? Some of them?

Well, you all talked me into it and at 6:30 this morning I downloaded it while my coffee was brewing. Then at 7:00 I turned on the TV and set my kids in front of it because I was hooked. It’s 3:00pm and I’m 70% of the way through. Dishes are stacked to the brim. Kids are still in pjs. Dogs are bored and glaring at me. Toys are everywhere. My bedroom was turned into a fort/nest.

AND THERE ARE THREE MORE BOOKS!?!?

How will I get anything done? Will anyone ever do the dishes? Will Paw Patrol rot my kids’ brains? Will Ender save the world??? Stay tuned...


Edit: I just stopped to make coffee, do the dishes, and make sure the kids were alive. It made me realize I was doing that scene in Neverending Story where the little boy has a sandwich or something and looks at the storm and hunkers back down with the book. Back to reading!

Edit 2: It’s over, it’s done. What a day, what a story. Back to the old grind. 

Edit 3: for anyone still listening, the Speaker for the Dead book has been started, and is good. Reminds me a lot of the Children of Time book so far. But that one was a single reader and I think this one will be too. Ender’s Game will definitely be a multi-reader. Thanks to my husband who came home early from work because of the holiday weekend and has been parenting since 5 while I engage on this mad quest to do all the reading. 

Edit 4: The Speaker book has gotten pretty good. The piggy/fence situation reminds me of the movie “The Village”.  Thanks everyone for letting me know that there’s like 90,000 books in the series. I’ll definitely read them all! But probably not the same way as Ender’s Game. It’s so rare that a book just surprises you like that.

This scene from chapter 9 in The Catcher in the Rye really stood out to me where Holden Caulfield is in a hotel room looking out the window and looking into other rooms.  In one room he sees a man dressing in women's clothing and in another room he sees a man and a woman spitting their drinks in each other's faces in a sexual way. 

Here is the scene in question, narrated by Holden:

""I saw one guy, a gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on, do something you wouldn't believe me if I told you.  First he put his suitcase on his bed.  Then he took out all these women's clothes, and put them on.  Real women's clothes, silk stockings, high-heeled shoes, brassiere, and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all.  Then he put on this very tight black evening dress.  I swear to God.  Then he started walking up and down the room, taking these very small steps, the way a woman does, and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror.  He was all alone, too.""

He then goes on to describe the couple squirting their drinks in each other's faces.

My interpretation is that the cross-dresser and the fore-playing couple are Holden Caulfield.  This is for a few reasons.  The first being that Holden clearly lies uncontrollably.  He had to keep himself from talking on the train to the lady next to him in order to stop lying.  It seems his narration that he ""saw"" these strange acts could be a lie, especially as it is prefaced by him narrating ""you wouldn't believe me if I told you.""  It seems likely he lies in his narration, too.

Furthermore, the cross-dressing man was a ""gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on...""  This sounds like Holden, who we know has a lot of gray hair on one side of his head.  This man was also alone, as was Holden, and was smoking a cigarette, as Holden had been doing frequently leading up to this scene.

The women's clothing were also described in such detail, it's difficult to believe he actually recognized each article of clothing from a distance.  And the man was looking at himself in the mirror, which brings me to the next scene.

The couples spitting their drinks at each other was Holden doing it to his reflection in the mirror.  Here is the scene: ""Anyway, first he'd take a swallow and squirt it all over her, then she did it to him, they took turns, for God's sake.""

And after that scene, Holden felt aroused and called up a promiscuous girl who's number he had, presumably to try to have sex.  It seems possible these strange acts Holden performed aroused him.

One other thing is that before Holden went to the hotel, he got into a fight with his roommate Stradlater in part because Holden was mad/jealous about Stradlater's date with Jane where they likely had sex.  Holden asked Stradlater if they did, to which Stradlater got on Holden's bed and playfully punched in in the shoulder ""in just his damn shorts and all,"" just like the man in the window.  Holden has previously shown interest in Stradlater's body, so that's just interesting to note.

Any thoughts on this?  I did some googling but didn't find anyone with the same interpretation, which I think is really interesting and compelling.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm asking this as someone who's not a big reader due to ADHD, my brain just refuses to cooperate no matter how much I may want to read something, but even when I do read I tend to read non-fiction as it's easier to digest. I find fiction impossible as I can't read for long and I can't maintain focus on what I'm reading to get into a story, I also have [Aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) so can't imagine what it is being described to me in a book.

Bookworms are into books in a way I don't think I could never understand - don't get me wrong, I love books as I was raised in a house full of books (my mother would spend hours reading, she could easily get through a  book a day) so I was raised to view them as something precious, but stories written within books are like some magical world I don't have access to. I don't understand how people can get so caught-up in the stories.

I hear people watching TV or film adaptations and say 'the book was better' but I have no idea how on earth words on a page could be comparable to a TV show or film, how a book can be so descriptive to be on comparison. I read each individual word, only half goes in, so I just can't see how bookworms see books.

I don't know what to make of this. Has to be fake, right? But if fake, WHY?

The handwriting is a sort of haphazard mixture of small caps, lower case, and cursive, and it looks pretty similar to examples of OJ's handwriting I found online. Also there is no actual signature, only ""The Juice"" crammed in the extreme lower right corner. It's possible OJ (or whoever signed it) ran out of room for a full signature.

Very strange.

Etsuko and Seiji Ogata were totally into each other, and still are. They want each other so bad. Jiro probably knows or senses it at some level.

No, really, I could make that case.

A) Etsuko introduces Ogata to us by first dwelling on his physical attractiveness, comparing him most favourably to Jiro. Let this sink in for a moment. If a guy were to start telling us about how sexy his mother-in-law was compared to his pudgy dowdy wife, well, God bless you please, Mrs Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you can know!

B) Their banter is of such a flirtatious nature that surely others have had the same notion I hold. Naughty words about withholding favours or doling out punishment while actually going the extra mile for him. Ribbing him about his ugly name. Him reciprocating by making fun of his own ugliness. If they were to ever get down to hot and heavy things it'd be kinky as all get out. Real potential for light BDSM dynamics here.

C) The azaleas. With the way that scene is constructed in the novel, the subtext of attachment, mutual desire and attraction, and repressed emotion is so strong that I think the azaleas got fertilised by their pheromones. There is the sense of finality in the way Ogata describes ""the day it was all finally decided. That you and Jiro were to be married"". That final decision caused Etsuko to make the wild presumptuous demand for a house with ""azaleas in the gateway"" if she was to live there, a demand Ogata complied with without delay. Subtext: ""if what we feel cannot be openly acknowledged, I must have at least a tacit symbolic acknowledgement. Give it to me, or I won't agree to this alternative socially-acceptable arrangement."" And Ogata is so obviously hurt by her momentary failure to grasp his reference to the azaleas, when he is standing by the window making it hard for Etsuko to see his expression. She doesn't need to, though. The mere use of this narrative contrivance tells us she knows full well the unspoken conversation they are having.

And more: she disavows the decision made by Jiro to move out into their own apartment. She knows that decision caused hurt. For her own part she wanted to stay, at least under the same roof as Ogata. Ogata's simple response of ""No"" is him giving her absolution for the moving out. This is some forbidden Sweet May Chill December love story right here.

D) ""Yes,very guilty. I wonder what Father gets up to when there's no one to keep an eye on him."" Oh wouldn't you like to know, Etsuko, wouldn't you like to know. 

2. The missing black silk tie. Ogata probably took it and was contemplating hanging himself, when he didn't come out of the bedroom that morning. Etsuko was disproportionately relieved when she called out and he answered, aftee Jiro had gone. The unspoken un-narrated thought must have occurred to her.

3. The use of international chess rather than Go is not, after all, on account of Ishiguro not being familiar with Go's mechanics, but because he really did want the somewhat quaint metaphors made possible by the mechanics of international chess. Instead of ""rook"", Ogata says ""castle"" - players don't usually use that term to describe the playing piece (albeit ""castling"" is a move), but here the effect is that the idea of a castle's fortifications is an apt metaphor for Jiro's attempt to stonewall his father regarding Shigeo Matsuda. Likewise, Ogata refers to the knight as a ""horse"", which frankly seems a bit odd. Here, however, it serves as a kind of metonym for travel, departure... Ogata is saying, in effect, that Jiro's decision to move out was ill-considered. Lots of things are happening in that scene of course, but the particular terms Ogata was using caused me tl change my mind about why the author chose to deploy chess rather than Go.

&lt;p&gt;D) &amp;quot;Yes,very guilty. I wonder what Father gets up to when there&amp;#39;s no one to keep an eye on him.&amp;quot; Oh wouldn&amp;#39;t you like to know, Etsuko, wouldn&amp;#39;t you like to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missing black silk tie. Ogata probably took it and was contemplating hanging himself, when he didn&amp;#39;t come out of the bedroom that morning. Etsuko was disproportionately relieved when she called out and he answered, aftee Jiro had gone. The unspoken un-narrated thought must have occurred to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of international chess rather than Go is not, after all, on account of Ishiguro not being familiar with Go&amp;#39;s mechanics, but because he really did want the somewhat quaint metaphors made possible by the mechanics of international chess. Instead of &amp;quot;rook&amp;quot;, Ogata says &amp;quot;castle&amp;quot; - players don&amp;#39;t usually use that term to describe the playing piece (albeit &amp;quot;castling&amp;quot; is a move), but here the effect is that the idea of a castle&amp;#39;s fortifications is an apt metaphor for Jiro&amp;#39;s attempt to stonewall his father regarding Shigeo Matsuda. Likewise, Ogata refers to the knight as a &amp;quot;horse&amp;quot;, which frankly seems a bit odd. Here, however, it serves as a kind of metonym for travel, departure... Ogata is saying, in effect, that Jiro&amp;#39;s decision to move out was ill-considered. Lots of things are happening in that scene of course, but the particular terms Ogata was using caused me tl change my mind about why the author chose to deploy chess rather than Go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I'm Mary Robinette Kowal and I have three unrelated careers. I'm an author, a professional puppeteer, and an audiobook narrator.

My short fiction is sort of all over the speculative fiction map. My novels are science-fiction or fantasy. (So far.) The first series, The Glamourist Histories, is sort of like Jane Austen with magic. Then I did Ghost Talkers, which is set in WWI with ghosts and mediums and spycraft and stuff like that. But you're probably interested in the Calculating Stars, which is book one of the Lady Astronaut duology. Oh! And if you want to read free stories, [I have some on my site](http://maryrobinettekowal.com/fiction-collectio/online-fiction/). I’m also a member of the Hugo-award winning podcast [Writing Excuses](https://writingexcuses.com/).

So there's also the puppetry. In high school, I was doing puppetry as a hobby, but I went after an art degree, minoring in theater and speech. While performing as Audrey II in a performance of Little Shop of Horrors, a professional puppeteer came to the show and I was like... ""Wait. People actually pay you? To do this?"" And pretty much changed career paths on the dime. I went on to intern at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA. With over twenty years of experience, I have performed for LazyTown (CBS), the Center for Puppetry Arts, Jim Henson Pictures and Sesame Street. You got questions about puppets? I got answers.

For the audiobook stuff, I'm a member of SAG/AFTRA. As the voice behind several audio books and short stories, I've recorded fiction for authors such as Neal Stephenson, Cory Doctorow and Seanan McGuire. And my own books, too. It's sorta like puppetry, without the pain.

I live in Chicago with my husband Robert and, at current count, nineteen manual typewriters.

And now random stuff -- I lived in Iceland for year and a half, working on the show Lazytown. Two cats. I'm obligated to mention the cats, right? I include a Doctor Who cameo in every novel. 

When I say that you can ask me anything, I really mean it. I’ll talk about everything from hand-sewing period costumes, to shoving my hand up things, to writing, to depression.

Especially with the hardships the master goes through in trying to publish his book about Pontius Pilate within the story, and the emotional toll that it takes on him.  

There are several stories that comengle and touch on one another but the main plot line is about the devil arriving in Moscow and what happens afterwards.  The terms of good and evil are examined and played with. This book can be comedic, and tragic all at once.  Bulgakov does a wonderful job mixing in humor with darker subject matter which will make you laugh and cry.

Bulgakov's writing will keep you immensly captured by his story.  I love all the people you meet along the way and the events that you sit in on!  I absolutely loved his characters, especially Woland! 

Did The Master and Margarita make you think of your own sense of good and evil?  Do you think Bulgakov was drawing parrelles between the master in his book and himself living in the censored Soviet Union?  Did the ending sit well with you and do you think he was making commentary on living under such harsh conditions?  This is such an amazing book, if you haven't  read it I highly recommend it.  If you've only read it once I would suggest giving it another read!  Definitely one of my favorite books in general, especially from a  Russian author! 

One of my favorite quotes from the book:

""The tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes never! You're asked an unexpected question, you don't even flinch, it takes just a second to get yourself under control, you know just what you have to say to hide the truth, and you speak very convincingly, and nothing in your face twitches to give you away. But the truth, alas, has been disturbed by the question, and it rises up from the depths of your soul to flicker in your eyes and all is lost.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The translation I read was from Burgin and O&amp;#39;Conner.  The Master and Margarita is a very powerful and sometimes pointed read that definitely illicited a wide swath of emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently almost done with The Warded Man, and I just finished reading about Leesha’s rape. This was kind of the final straw for me for this book and I wanted to hear some other people’s thoughts because I know this is a pretty popular series. 

I’ve had issues with the way Brett wrote Leesha from the beginning. He seemed to present her as this girl that was constantly crying and weak, and spent a weird amount of time and detail describing her and Gared’s hook up when she was literally only 12, which was really gross to me. I do appreciate her growth as an extremely competent Herb Gatherer and she did grow up quite a bit, but I find it really frustrating that she kept up her habit of crying at the first sign of inconvenience or danger rather than maybe expanding on her skills as an Herb Gatherer and drawing strength them. I kind of feel like that this is just some kind of personal fantasy that he’s projected on Leesha of this beautiful girl that’s incapable of taking care of herself and has to rely on other people constantly, and I’m hoping that I haven’t made it far enough in the series to see her fully develop as a character. The way he’s written her up to this point just really turned me off to this series to the point where I’m questioning if I want to finish it. 

In general, I have an issue with how much rape is used as a plot device in fantasy books. Before anyone lays into me for this, I understand that the time period and setting for most fantasy books is in a time where rape was very common, but I just don’t understand why it’s so vital to so many plots. Leesha’s just seemed so crude and unnecessary, and Brett only seemed to use it to drive the point home that she’s fragile and needs someone to take care of her. 

I’d love to know if this is how it continues for the rest of the series because I really do enjoy the story, but I just can’t handle how Brett is writing this character that has so much more potential than a simpering wallflower. 

Without going into detail and also as something I’d like to not focus on, I’m a victim of sexual assault and I try to make sure that that isn’t something that influences my life and other experiences I have. Because of that, I’d also like to know if anyone else gets the sense that women in fantasy go through some shit, or if this is just something I’m more sensitive to and is something I can work on.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all.

That's how I first heard of it. I read it over the past week and it's an excellent gothic novel, I definitely want to read more of Waters' novels after this one.

I had an interesting theory about the ""ghost"" in the story after finishing it and wanted to get some discussion about it.

Towards the end, Caroline suggests that the ghost may actually be a poltergeist caused by Rod's mental stress. In parapsychology a ""poltergeist"" is generally thought to be psychic energy created by a living person, not the spirit of someone dead.

I think the poltergeist is actually Dr. Faraday.

Faraday has always been fascinated by Hundreds Hall - in the beginning, he tells us about when he broke off a piece of the molding as a child, since he wanted a part of the house for himself, even if it meant damaging part of it. His marriage to Caroline at the end seems to have the same selfish goal - what he really wants is to inherit the house, and he disregards her happiness and mental state to get it.

I think Faraday is unaware he's causing anything to happen (typical of poltergeist cases), and genuinely is a skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. But the events caused by the haunting are serving his subconscious desire to remove the Ayres family and take the house for himself.

He's born from a lower class and, as a doctor, he's a self-made man who strives to be like the wealthy upper class but doesn't have the ""old money"" background like the Ayres. The house probably represents that to him, and he makes reasons to stay with the family (as their doctor) so he can be there as often as possible, and eventually gets the idea to marry Caroline (but I think all she really represents to him is the house).

I think a subconscious part of Faraday hates the Ayres family for not taking proper care of the place. Rod and Mrs Ayres already have unstable mental conditions, but I think they actually did witness supernatural activity. Their condition just made them more susceptible to it, and then Faraday can diagnose them as unstable and seems almost eager to get them out of the house.

I didn't really think of Faraday as the ""antagonist"" of the novel until he started pressuring Caroline to marry him, but really all throughout the novel he's working to get Rod and Mrs Ayres to get committed to institutions, he kills Gyp ""because it's the right thing to do"", and generally manipulates Caroline so that they can marry and (more importantly) he becomes the owner of the house.

And in the end, when Hundreds Hall is abandoned (partially because of the ghost stories), he still has the key and still goes back to ""maintain"" the empty house. He's also unaffected by the ghost, despite how much time he spent in the house. The final paragraph suggests he was the thing haunting the family all along:

&gt; If Hundreds Hall is haunted, however, its ghost doesn't show itself to me. For I'll turn, and am disappointed - realising that what I am looking at is only a cracked window-pane, and that the face gazing distortedly from it, baffled and longing, is my own.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume there&amp;#39;s probably some of you reading this book, since the movie adaptation comes out tomorrow.

I just finished The Road by  Cormac McCarthy  a few days ago, and against all the critics and the Pullitzer Price that it received, I didn't like the book so much. 

I know the book is very special, by the facts that they are no chapters, the characters are totally disincarnated (no name, very few physical description), no informations on where does the story take place, on the past of the world or on his future, etc. 

I know that it was intended by the author to make it the more universal story possible I think, but it keeps me emotionally  out of it, I didn't get attached to the characters or to the world. I don't discredit the author at all, Cormac McCarthy have a huge writing talent, of description and atmosphere, it's really impressive. But at the end, I feel like there not much a story in there, that's it's way too much philosophic and allegoric for me, except for two or three moments. 

There are a lot of people who enjoy the book, there are some who had the same experience as me. What do you think of The Road ? 

And also my other question is, The Road is the first Pullitzer Winner book that I read, are they all like that ? I've not a very high reading level, I would say I'm an average reader, should I avoid Pullitzer Winners ? Or was this a misluck experience ?

At all. 

Though I do love to read, I never could force myself to sit down with *To Kill a Mockingbird* or *Jane Eyre* outside of a school setting. For whatever reason, renowned literary classics all seem to have a really long, really boring introduction at the beginning in which nearly nothing happens except the characters are introduced in the most ‘tell-not-show’ way possible. And even though the books are - obviously - old, and will therefore have an older writing style, I just couldn’t find the strength to plough through it. Heck, I even struggled reading *Anne of Green Gables*.

I figured, for a long time, that I just wasn’t a classics person. I would never be in the upper-class of the literature world, but instead be forever confined to the looked-down-upon YA books that I somehow never grew out of. That aspect didn’t really bother me; why waste time reading something *slow* and *boring* when I could be reading about a teenage half-dragon princess leading a rebellion against her own kingdom (or something?) without the convoluted writing style or depth that many classics seem to have (that inevitably flew over my head)?

Well, I’m here to tell you that I was wrong.

My friend recommended *Emma* to me on the one condition that I would read it. All of it.

I recognized the author, but apart from that, that’s all I recognized. To give you an idea of how detached I was from the literate elite, I thought Pride and Prejudice was about *war*. 

You can imagine my confusion when *Emma* was...also not about war.

I’m not going to lie, the first chapter was *rough*. As soon as I read the first sentence - “Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, blah blah blah...” I thought, *oh boy. Here we go.*

But...I actually really liked it. 

Even though the writing style was old, it didn’t *feel* old. In fact, it read like a modern romantic comedy. Emma’s antics were actually pretty funny, and one scene especially - in which Emma literally pries her shoelace off and chucks it into the bushes as an excuse to give two characters more alone time - made me laugh out loud. I usually hate romance novels, but I would actually go as far to say that Jane Austen’s books are probably the only kind of romance that I’m able to stomach.

At one point, I remember thinking, “*This* is what people are so excited about?” I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t what I expected at all: it wasn’t full of messages I didn’t understand or weighed down by language or any of those things. It was just fun. 

That being said, I absolutely understand why it’s highly regarded - Austen has a way of creating characters and situations that are completely timeless and authentic, as well as providing a glimpse into the social climate of the 1800s. 

I definitely encourage anyone who’s never had a taste for classics to give this book a try. There are a couple things I would recommend, however, rather than jumping in blindly:

**Get a copy that’s annotated,** or at the very least has footnotes of some kind. Mine was an Oxford copy that I got from the library, and the definitions and historical context notes at the back were so, so helpful when reading. Otherwise, I never would have known that shaking hands were only reserved for close friends, or that calling someone by their first name was considered highly disrespectful if you didn’t know them personally. It really helps you understand what you’re reading. However, *don’t* read the introduction until after you’ve read the book. It contains a whole bunch of spoilers.

**Keep track of the characters.** A ton will be introduced at the beginning, and many of them will be important later. I started writing notes on them but later stopped when I became used to remembering who’s-who. Also: DO NOT look up any character maps or notes online, because you WILL run into spoilers. :( That’s why it’s good to use an annotated edition, so the notes are right there and you don’t have to search around in the angry abyss of the Internet for them. 

And finally, **you will get used to the prose after a while.** The old style annoyed me at first, but now I can’t imagine the story being told any other way. 

Anyway, that’s all! Because I liked *Emma* so much, I’m probably going to read *Mansfield Park* next (although I’m scared that it won’t measure up!!) ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a big ‘classics’ reader. At all. &lt;/p&gt;

I usually hate romance novels, but I would actually go as far to say that Jane Austen’s books are probably the only kind of romance that I’m able to stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, I remember thinking, “&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what people are so excited about?” I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t what I expected at all: it wasn’t full of messages I didn’t understand or weighed down by language or any of those things. It was just fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I absolutely understand why it’s highly regarded - Austen has a way of creating characters and situations that are completely timeless and authentic, as well as providing a glimpse into the social climate of the 1800s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely encourage anyone who’s never had a taste for classics to give this book a try. There are a couple things I would recommend, however, rather than jumping in blindly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a copy that’s annotated,&lt;/strong&gt; or at the very least has footnotes of some kind. Mine was an Oxford copy that I got from the library, and the definitions and historical context notes at the back were so, so helpful when reading. Otherwise, I never would have known that shaking hands were only reserved for close friends, or that calling someone by their first name was considered highly disrespectful if you didn’t know them personally. It really helps you understand what you’re reading. However, &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; read the introduction until after you’ve read the book. It contains a whole bunch of spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep track of the characters.&lt;/strong&gt; A ton will be introduced at the beginning, and many of them will be important later. I started writing notes on them but later stopped when I became used to remembering who’s-who. Also: DO NOT look up any character maps or notes online, because you WILL run into spoilers. :( That’s why it’s good to use an annotated edition, so the notes are right there and you don’t have to search around in the angry abyss of the Internet for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;strong&gt;you will get used to the prose after a while.&lt;/strong&gt; The old style annoyed me at first, but now I can’t imagine the story being told any other way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s all! Because I liked &lt;em&gt;Emma&lt;/em&gt; so much, I’m probably going to read &lt;em&gt;Mansfield Park&lt;/em&gt; next (although I’m scared that it won’t measure up!!) &lt;/p&gt;

The first time I noticed this problem was through my reading of Stephen Kings ""IT"". 300-400 Pages through the book I was really invested in it and thought the story awesome. But then a scene happened, in which a woman was abused by her violent boyfriend, that brought me to a stop. I just couldn't read further. My stomach hurt every time I thought about those scenes and all the previous emotions of joy were now just in disgust. The same feeling happened in some other books that were recommended to me.
 
There is no problem when I watch violent movies or play bloody videogames. When something graphical is happening in this media I normally think to myself ""oh fuck that was intense"" but when I read those passages in books it's more like ""meh there is no joy in this, it just hurts"" 

My fear is to misjudge books by this flaw of mine. For example I almost stopped reading the game of Thrones series because of the Sansa pov's.

I know that quite a few posts already exist, but I didn't feel like I could just put my comments onto an old thread and I'm also wondering if someone might be able to help me out with studying the book. I read it in a paperback version from the library, but I'm going to immediately buy the digital version so I can highlight and write notes the second time around. Does anyone have any suggestions for reading guides or discussion groups for this book? 

I've read a few of Steinbeck's other works (Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, The Grapes of Wrath, The Pearl) and while I appreciated them, none of them had nearly the beauty or impact that ""East of Eden"" did. I started reading it because of all the recommendations here on this sub and I just finished it less than 20 minutes ago. I spent at least 7 hrs. reading in the past 2 days, I just couldn't stop. 

I've read a lot of novels I'd been told I should love and haven't. I've read countless classics that were just a chore. This was an experience that I wasn't really prepared for, even after all the glowing reviews. I didn't skip a single word. I never found myself scanning or skipping paragraphs. I was simultaneously rabidly jealous of Steinbeck's mastery of words and imagery as well as deeply sad that he's gone. I can't count the number of times I read a sentence or paragraph two or three times in a row, just to savor it. I know there's more of his work that I haven't read, but I want MORE than that even. Hope that makes sense. 

For me, the commentary on cycles, on life and death, were more impactful than the good vs. evil themes. As a middle aged woman, reading about people confronting their mortality head on was refreshing and reassuring. I couldn't even BEGIN to list my favorite lines, but this paragraph hit me like a ton of bricks, "" “I’m a nosy old man, Adam. And the sad thing to me is that I’m losing my  nosiness. That’s maybe how I know it’s time to visit my children. I’m  having to pretend to be nosy a good deal of the time.”""

I can already feel the beginnings of that in myself, even at 41. I'm not on the cutting edge of technology anymore. I don't know who all the new, popular musicians and actors are. I don't want to spend hours just sitting around, talking about other people. I don't understand ASMR or why kids think it's satisfying to watch soap being cut! I've lost a lot of my nosiness already. That paragraph felt similar to the descriptions I've read in other books about very old vampires just losing interest in everything before walking into the sun. 

On a different note, Lee is by far my favorite character. I laughed out loud quite a few times at his dialogue. His tragic back story absolutely took my breath away. 

Alright, I think that's all I have to say before I really put a lot of energy into studying. I can't wait to see how much I consciously noticed and subconsciously picked up on.

The book is said to be the inspiration for Phantome de l'Opera. But is more so a study in Bohemia.


The book is wordy, onerously so. The author takes a page and a half for what could be conveyed in one sentence. The text almost seems pretentiously written. It makes frequent allusions to authors, artists of the time. It made me feel clever and intelligent for recognizing names and stupid all at once for not being able to appreciate the metaphors.


The lengthy paragraphs are made worse with the heavily salted French interspersed at about once per page. I'm familiar with some French, but was using Google Translate for about half the phrases. 


Throughout, the author is reminiscent of France, putting himself on the periphery of the characters. He expounds on rues, boulevards, venues, and restaurants. This first hand account requires the reader to have a knowledge of Paris either before or during reading.


The characters are thoroughly examined. Their portrait studies can go for pages. So then, their actions can become predictable. Nothing really seems to happen for the first half of the book. We are thoroughly introduced to Billie, the Laird and Taffy. I admit, I got the Laird and Taffy confused in my mind. The author reminds each time about the characters traits so that you can remember who it is that's doing the action. The other main characters, Trilby and Svengali make a believable interaction. Their periphery friends are inconsequential.


There seems to be a lack of action on everyone's part. I can't remember the word, but Billie's mother acts as pro and antagonist. That's when things get rolling, in the second half of the book - and ever so slowly still!


This book got great reception when released. I'd say because it was in the papers as a French tourist advertisement.


I'll give du Maurier this: the lengthy descriptions are artfully written. When taking in a saturated paragraph at a time, it would be easy to linger in the subtleties and allusions of each one.

A great read overall! But I’m curious why Ellis chose to title it after this Elvis Costello song. Obviously the title refers to Costello’s 1977 song from the album My Aim is True. And Imperial Bedrooms in turn refers to Costello’s 1982 album Imperial Bedroom. 

Costello’s “Less Than Zero” lyrically refers to the British neofascist and racist Oswald Mosley going on TV attempting to deny his hateful actions. This rightfully pissed Costello off, and I understand reading the song on that level. 

But I’m unsure how lyrically Costello’s song relates to Ellis’s novel, if at all. Maybe Ellis simply listened to a lot of Costello (Clay has a Costello poster, Blair and Clay used to listen to Costello’s records). Does Costello’s music evoke an aesthetic fitting of the novel and its themes? 

When I think of 80s music, I don’t really think of Costello. Ellis’s later reference in Less Than Zero to Randy Newman’s ironic “I Love LA” makes more sense to me.

I don’t know that much about Elvis Costello or his music, or the 80s music scene, so I’m curious about why Ellis was inspired to name both novels after Costello’s music. Maybe someone on here can explain why?

It is just like the equivelent of a fan who reads too many books (thrillers, fantasy, science fiction, comic, or even Shakespearian works), and becomes anyone he wants to do, just like Don Quixote. These examples of who would they become would include:

\- Becoming a detective or a professor but in reality, it is impossible to proof it to the police, nor they would allow you to teach history, or even investigate a crime scene.

\- Becoming a wizard or a sorcerer, but in reality, there is no magic in the real world and he would not be like Harry Potter, or Lord Voldemort.

\- Becoming a jedi warrior or a space captain, but, again in reality, the fans of Star Wars and Star Trek would call him crazy if he is imagining a spaceship in the sky.

\- Becoming a comical woman like in most 50s shows, but in reality (why do i keep saying it over and over again?), There is no way to become one unless you are hired by the three or four networks like NBC, CBS, ABC, or The CW, in order to be part of a show (alas a sitcom).

\- Or even becoming each or one of the characters from William Shakespeare, those include Romeo and Juilet and Hamlet (which they are the most famous works from him).

Those are the examples of a big fan that would become those that i have pointed out to you.

Speaking of the 4th example, i will say this, Don Quixote is the medieval version of the sitcom I Love Lucy, the reason?

Well, because DQ is episodic, some people read every chapter of this book as a episode (either as a sitcom or a satrical series), and they would take a break for now and come back for after, later, or even tomorrow, so that they can treat it as a series.

Also, just like DQ, I Love Lucy has humor as well (which those notable examples include Lucy testing Vitametavegamin in the first season's well known episode, Lucy and Ethel in the candy factory fiasco in Season 2's Job Switching, and so on and etc.).

I can also compare between Lucy and Ricky Riccardo and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, but with differences. Ricky does the drums while Sancho rides the ass (which is technically a donkey) and worked for the goverment in the second part, and Lucy works as his housewife, wanting to become a star, while Don Quixote becomes a madman, trying and wanting to right the wrongs of the world.

That is why DQ is the medieval equivelent of I Love Lucy, and i wonder if you can compare Miguel De Cervantes's novel with anything that you remembered or watched in recent years.

NOTE: I have Tom Lathrop's version (which is a translated version of the original 1605 and 1615 versions of the book), but i still want to read Edith's translation before his take.

I haven't read anything else by Tart, but after hearing good things about *The Goldfinch* and that it won the Pulitzer in 2014 and will be getting the movie treatment, I thought I'd be sold on this book. Turns out it was actually one of the most frustrating reads I'd experienced.

Many people have compared the book to a modern-day Dickens novel, but anyone who has said that must have read very little Dickens. One of the best parts of Dickens' stories is that they all feel very tight and complete -- most actions have direct consequences and most characters that are mentioned end up coming back and playing a key role, typically in part due to a twist. Dickens often also used his books in order to provide a commentary and critique of the contemporary moment in which it was written.

Compare that to something like *The Goldfinch.* Characters are introduced which have no real meaning or influence on the plot despite seeming important. In fact, almost every character is like this. The doorman at Theo's original apartment, Pippa, who Theo falls in love with (despite having no real chemistry) and who just rejects him throughout the book, the entire Barbour family who disappears in the final act (including Theo's fianceé Kitsey who he just leaves in the middle of their engagement party and then never talks to again for the rest of the book). I could go on, but there are so many loose threads that just don't end up with any conclusion, let alone a satisfying one. The only character who comes back in the end in a significant way is Boris, who I admit is at least pretty interesting.

Boris' arrival and the climax of the book, however, reveals the entire main conflict driving the story to be a contrivance. The painting that Theo steals and then feels guilt for saving for much of his life is merely returned for a large sum of money and no one gets in trouble for stealing it... Something that should have been done *ages* ago. It makes no sense and makes everything feel hollow.

When the book finally does end, rather than wrapping things up in even a remotely neat fashion, it pretty much just has Theo ramble on for pages about his depressing outlook on life, wherein Tart seems to be trying to give the audience her grand life advice, which is to say, there is no real life advice worth giving. It was incredibly disappointing and made me come away from the book with no real lesson learned (of which there could have been many). I suppose she may have been going for a Prodigal Son-type story with Theo and Hobie, but it's a bit of a reach.

I know I've been very critical of the book here, and not all of it was bad. But I just cannot fathom how a book with this many issues and this poor of writing won a *Pulitzer* and got compared to *Dickens* consistently. Anyone else feel similarly?

The doorman at Theo&amp;#39;s original apartment, Pippa, who Theo falls in love with (despite having no real chemistry) and who just rejects him throughout the book, the entire Barbour family who disappears in the final act (including Theo&amp;#39;s fianceé Kitsey who he just leaves in the middle of their engagement party and then never talks to again for the rest of the book). I could go on, but there are so many loose threads that just don&amp;#39;t end up with any conclusion, let alone a satisfying one. The only character who comes back in the end in a significant way is Boris, who I admit is at least pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boris&amp;#39; arrival and the climax of the book, however, reveals the entire main conflict driving the story to be a contrivance. The painting that Theo steals and then feels guilt for saving for much of his life is merely returned for a large sum of money and no one gets in trouble for stealing it... Something that should have been done &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; ago. It makes no sense and makes everything feel hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the book finally does end, rather than wrapping things up in even a remotely neat fashion, it pretty much just has Theo ramble on for pages about his depressing outlook on life, wherein Tart seems to be trying to give the audience her grand life advice, which is to say, there is no real life advice worth giving. It was incredibly disappointing and made me come away from the book with no real lesson learned (of which there could have been many). I suppose she may have been going for a Prodigal Son-type story with Theo and Hobie, but it&amp;#39;s a bit of a reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;ve been very critical of the book here, and not all of it was bad. But I just cannot fathom how a book with this many issues and this poor of writing won a &lt;em&gt;Pulitzer&lt;/em&gt; and got compared to &lt;em&gt;Dickens&lt;/em&gt; consistently. Anyone else feel similarly? Or am I in the minority?&lt;/p&gt;

I have a few theories on the book, if you have read it too and understand it better, can you tell me if any of this is correct or maybe can explain it better?


**Warning this next part contains spoilers.**




---------------------------------------------



(Spoilers!)


&gt;!**Theory #1**:
The main character is depressed, and to cope with such depression has recessed into the deep wells of his mind. Recreating within' it the world around him. But all of the characters in his mind are just figments of his own consciousness and as a result they do not, they cannot love nor show emotion back. They simply *are there*, playing back responses, interacting with him. **The Town** offers him this comfort, a tranquility free of rejection and free of all of the mishaps of life. His **Shadow** is his real self, dying away but yearning to experience life. However the **Gatekeeper** is his depression, severing the ties between the two and keeping him locked away in his own downwards spiral. At the end, when he lies back in his car it is to my best guess that he then takes his own life.!&lt;

---------------


Now normally I'd go home with this theory, but then I can't help but feel this story is a double-edged sword and slices two stories in one. Here is yet another theory of mine.


--------------------------------------------------------------


(Spoilers!)
&gt;!**Theory #2**: The main character lives in distant future that has been consumed by war, fed up with devastation **The Town** was created. With its creation it sought to solve humanity by separation of **The Mind** (emotions, memories, drive, etc). Without this, there would be no more conflict and The Town would live peacefully forever. So what is **The Shadow** then? Take this with a grain of salt, but I believe in order to live within' The Town one must become an android. Functionally identical to your real self, flesh and all, experiences consciousness, pain, and might even live forever. But with it comes a price, you are split in two, and you feel no emotion as an **Android**. Your **real self** is really **The Shadow** and your Android then goes on to live in The Town. Since you cannot really experience emotion, only figments of emotion, you rely on your shadow. But as a shadow is only human, it will die, taking with it memories, emotions, and everything that matters.!&lt;


----------------------


&gt;!Why did I come up with Theory #2? The Gorilla with a human brain and a quote from the protagonist himself ""Was this body really mine?"". Along with several other key lines in the book that point towards this being a real possibility. Of course both theories are nowhere *near* perfect so bear with me.!&lt;

The way he is self aware, yet perfectly explains the thought process of someone with anxiety. Wishing you could maintain eye contact with someone and then get mad at yourself when you're always the first to break it. Thinking everyone around you must see your flaws as you do and so you separate yourself from them as to not inconvenience them with your presence all while being envious of their acceptance of their own flaws. Holding grudges for years against someone who likely doesn't even know you exist just because they inconvenienced you. The way he jumps from subject to subject because your thoughts are always scattered.

​

Then the sense of entitlement. Since your anxiety controls you, a social life doesn't exist or the relationships are short lasting and so you resort to reading. Because you're so well read and everyone is off being social, you assume you're more intelligent than everyone else.  Which snowballs the anxiety because you can't imagine socializing with someone who isn't as enlightened as you. You have to maintain this facade because it's the only positive thoughts you have.

This book is hitting close to home because I went through similar feelings during my 20's and into my 30's. How could people do that to ME? How dare they be disrespectful to ME! Everything everyone does is intentional because everything I do is intentional. The reason people don't get me is because I'm just too enlightened.

Took me a long time to realize I'm not that important and anything I thought I've done doesn't mean shit.

No one is going to remember the tons of hours I spent crafting arguments on social media and getting SO worked up and then deleting the comments because I worried about how people portrayed me. No one cares and people don't think about me as nearly as much as I think they do.

So I'm on a Neil Gaiman marathon right now and I'm just going through the books that I currently have. I recently finished ""American Gods"" so I was still in the mood for more Norse-esque storytelling. So I decided to read this book next and I was not disappointed. I knew little to nothing about Norse Mythology (other than the Marvel movies, but even then they change A LOT of things), I thought this was real user-friendly and Gaiman really simplified it in a way that was both interesting and captivating. I could not put this book down, if I wasn't in school or at work, I'm reading Norse Mythology. I started the book roughly a week ago and I can't believe how fast I got it done. It was so bizarre yet fascinating, so strange yet satisfying. By far, Loki is my favorite character in all of Norse Mythology but not for one second would I have my back turned on him.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I can't wait to keep reading more Gaiman books. Last time I checked, the next one on the list is Anansi Boys. Also wanted to know what did y'all think of Gaiman's Norse Mythology? Where would you rank it in Gaiman's standard of writing?

Or even something like *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer, which is of course sci-fi, but also falls in pretty well with a lot of the staples of Southern Gothic and is in the American South, but I'm sure it's also a question of whether or not Southern Gothic makes up a substantial enough portion of the authors work to lump them in with that genre.

“We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we really are.” 
 - Sirius Black, “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.”

“Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.” 
“Walk the paths of logic. Every outcome has its cause ... every predicament has its solution.”

I'm currently studying and doing some research into 'New Adult' and whether or not there is an audience for it. It's books that are aimed for people who read YA but older in terms of 'voice' and 'tone'. When a 17yo is sobbing her heart out over her first break-up - yes, it's world-wrecking and I'm going to read it.

But what about your second heartbreak? Or your third? What about the 22 year old rogue taking on the king and taming dragons?

I think there's a growing dissonance between Young Adult and Adult literature. Young Adult was defined as transitional between Children and Adult but I'd argue that it has become its own category of itself. I love that it spans genres, I still love YA - but I'm wanting more than first love/fifteen year olds taking on the king. I love Adult - crime, romance, fantasy, history etc - I'm all over it - but I'm also looking for that section after ""high school"" but before ""family"" or ""settling/putting down roots"".

I've just finished Assassin's Fate by Robin Hobb, after slowly working my way through the entire Elderling Universe over the past year or so. I often see Robin Hobb applauded as one of the finest writers in the world of fantasy at the moment, and she's quite unusual from a series-style perspective due to the fact her series follow intertwining characters over a number of separate 'cycles'.

I suppose what's prompted me to write this post is that I personally haven't particularly enjoyed the Elderling Universe, and I'm struggling to put my finger on why. Reading reviews for the books once I've finished, and seeing reviews on here, shows that the majority of people seem to be raving about it, but I truly don't understand why.

Spoilers ahead.

Let's start with the Liveship Traders. I wasn't too fond when I first read this, however found it stood up much better on a re-read. Out of the Elderling Universe, I probably enjoyed this one best, including the characters. While it's a lengthy series, it generally had enough going on to keep it interesting. My main dislike of the series, and an issue that I have with all of Hobb's books, is that she spends all this time developing her villains, then dispatches them in unbelievably unsatisfying ways. Kyle Haven, who was probably one of her most relatable villains, was killed off in the middle of a battle by accident, without ever facing comeuppance for what he'd done to his wife and family. It upset me that she'd spent the time building up the character and developing him in increasingly worse ways, only to get rid of him conveniently with no real closure. On a positive note, the development of Althea and Malta as characters was very satisfying and thoroughly enjoyable. 

Moving on to the Rain Wild Chronicles, which is the main 'related' series to the Liveship Traders. By far the weakest of the entire universe, this series read like a bad YA outing (coming from someone who doesn't mind an occasional foray into the YA group). Unbelievably repetitive and dragged out into four books, the entire thing was about who would mate with who and who should be in charge of the pairing. That aside, another decent villain, Hest Finbok, finally reaches a stage where a good stand off should be imminent, and gets eaten by a dragon which nobody else sees happen or knows about! It was maddening.

Onto Hobb's main event- the life and development of Fitz and the Fool. A bastard prince &gt; turned kinda-assassin &gt; whining man and a character-swapping prophet who uses the other to change the events of the world. I stuck with the series, I really did, but just found it to be one disappointment after another. 

Contrary to the majority of opinions I seem to see, I really did not like the character of the Fool. He consistently used Fitz with often zero explanation as to why, and acted like a petulant child when Fitz (rightly) became frustrated with him. The other, main side of his character is Amber, who appears as a character mainly in the Liveship Traders series. I found her to be even worse, in the sense that she had all of the Fool's worst traits with seemingly no nice ones. 

In terms of Fitz, he consistently manages to make his situation worse through the entirety of his life, with only a few short respites. I don't think I've ever read such a downtrodden character. He makes multiple poor decisions the entire way through then sits feeling sorry for himself for the majority of the time. Again, his story is very repetitive and the get swathes could be cut out with no actual loss to the plot of the main story.

Specifically about Assassin's Fate, as it's the final book in the instalment and the one that's prompted me to write this post, I rarely feel so deflated at the ending of a book. The entire three books of this series focus on Fitz trying to build a relationship with his daughter, followed by trying to rescue his daughter from a situation that the Fool has put her in. The Fool in this series was infuriating- considering that Fitz is supposedly his closest friend and his 'other half', he repeatedly hurts him with no regard for the effect that he's having. The main thing that stuck out to me was his complete disregard for Fitz's feelings when insisting that Bee is his daughter; it felt uncomfortable and needless. Assassin's Fate was interesting in the sense that it brought together characters from each area of Hobb's Elderling Universe, and to some degree I enjoyed the way she tied the characters in. But some new characters seemed incredibly unnecessary to add, and the book dragged on for far, far too long. 

As per my previous comments, the actual rescue of Bee and destruction of the Servants and Clerres was the build up for three books, then over within maybe 30 pages. What?! The reader doesn't even see the majority of the finale because they're bystanders! 

In relation to the ending itself, Fitz returns to the place that his King, Verity, dies at the end of the final book after carving and putting his awareness into a stone dragon. Fitz begins to carve his Wolf, after his Witted companion Nighteyes, with the intention of doing the same as Verity as he's slowly dying from a poison administered by the Servants. I guess I saw the ending coming from a long way off, but it doesn't stop it being any less upsetting. I just can't believe that the entire final series is one frustrating mess after another, only for Fitz to die without seeing any of the benefit of what he's done. 

I'm sure that to anyone reading this, I come across as absolutely hating Robin Hobb as an author and everything she's ever written. I'm keen to stress that I don't; I wouldn't have continued with the universe if I didn't believe it had potential. However I feel like I was constantly sticking with it because I was thinking it would get better, and just found that it didn't. I felt that on the whole, with the exception of a couple that I really enjoyed, it had potential to be fantastic but in reality it was only...okay.

The four potential mothers met as teenagers and all had the potential to become pregnant.  Potential spoilers beyond this point.

​

I'm about a third of the way through and, so far, I think the book is about freedom, specifically the freedom after the second world war, specifically in Europe, specifically for women, and specifically for these four women.  So far, I've seen Maxine and Judy's stories.  The former opens her own business, becoming more successful than her husband, and I love their relationship.  It's balanced; she spends so much of her time in charge that it makes sense that their relationship balances that out sexually, with him being more dominant while she is more submissive.  Because of the open talk of sex and sexuality, the book became famous and was also dismissed as a 'bonkbuster', as women's fiction ('chicklit'), and a precursor to novels like 50 Shades of Grey.  I admit, I haven't read the latter, but from what I've heard, *Lace* has a more accurate and more responsible portrayal.  It's loving and playful.

​

Judy works in the fashion industry, which underwent a massive boost after the wartime rationing was reduced.  Suddenly, women who had been cutting down their husbands suits had money and freedom and designers had fabric to play with.  Again, the growth of this industry in post-wartime reflects the post-war freedom of women, as they expanded into new areas and had the option of having careers alongside or instead of husbands.  Her designer friend says to Judy, at one point, (paraphrased, cba to find the quote) ""We did think you were young, but you could be in charge of a little baby at 23, so why not a little business?"".

​

The four potential mothers were born into a world where women always had careers (again, war), where it was normal to live outside the home.  They didn't know, as little girls, that that was new and unusual.  It reminds me of a section in Geri Halliwell's biography, when she describes where 'girl power' arose from.  For English women born in the '70s, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and a woman was on the throne.  They didn't know it wasn't normal for women to be in charge.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;^ that&amp;#39;s the line that closes the first chapter of Shirley Conran&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Lace&lt;/em&gt;.  In the 1980s, four successful career women are invited to meet with a young actress, ostensibly for something to do with their careers.

I think I took 4 or 5 days to finish it, but I think this book is best savored rather than binged.

I loved every single page of this ridiculously well-written story. Characters floored me. Dialogue floored me. The *story* floored me. I don’t give a singular shit if the historical accuracy isn’t there; I’m an American and I read this strictly as fiction. In my eyes, the people who write off this book because they disagree with King’s interpretation of the assassination are fools.

And dear God, that ending. Yeah, I’m a guy who sheds tears a lot—I mean a *lot*—while reading or watching. Just recently, I probably cried during like 3 or 4 movies. And during this book, my cheeks were soaked during the performance of *Of Mice and Men.* It was such a heartwarming and simultaneously heartbreaking moment. Maybe I’m wrong, but I also saw it as a little foreshadowing for this ending. Now, for the ending itself. I didn’t cry at all. I have no idea why. The opposite of George, I was dry-eyed in those final pages but not so during the rest of the book. It was so weird, I can’t explain it, especially considering that the ending was incredibly heartbreaking and should bring anyone who resonated with this story to tears.

This is the best book I’ve ever read. Now that I’m finished with it—it’s the morning after—I have no idea where to go next. I know I’m going to read another one of King’s books, but just the thought that there won’t be another chance for Sadie and George will haunt me for a while, I think.

**The Glass Jar** - *Greta Gerwig* It would probably play out like a darker and slower, less extroverted version of Lady Bird.

**The Secret History** - *Vince Gilligan* He's never directed a movie before and I might be biased, being a huge fan of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. And I have heard that Donna Tartt doesn't want it to be adapted, ever. But hey, one can dream.

**Norwegian Wood** - Sofia Coppola. Yes, I know there is already an adaptation of this one. Yes, I know not all her movies are great. Yes, I know I'm once again biased because Norwegian Wood is one of my favourite novels and Lost in Translation one of my favourite films. But imagine if she goes back to the tone of that LiT, instead of her more recent works. Having it take place in New York, maybe even present day. That'd be awesome IMO.

**The Never Ending Story** - *Hayao Miyazaki, or just Studio Ghibli in general* Fuck the attention span of children, this movie should be over three hours long. Imagine. IMAGINE!

Anyway, what books would you like to see adapted, and by which director? Be creative and unexpected. The movies don't need to be very similar to the books even. Let your imaginations run free!

I just turned 14 and last Christmas, I got *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*. in that year I had read *Watchmen*, *Divergent*, *Between Shades of Gray* (another AMAZING book), and *Fahrenheit 451*, but not much else. I used to be a really big reader (like, 4 books at once), but Reddit and my phone have absolutely *obliterated* my attention span, so normally, getting into a book is kind of a big deal for me (sorry for the massive run-on sentence). I still love to read, but normally, I can only do r/nosleep and r/shortscarystories type stuff (mad respect for the folks that put out stuff over on those subreddits).

So anyway, I had asked for *The Perks of Being a Wallflower* for Christmas because I’d seen the movie a couple years before, and *loved* it. I remember that I had asked for the book a while back, but at the time, my mom wasn’t totally on board with me reading it (love you, u/YourMamaIsLovely). My language arts teacher that year (a *fantastic* guy) had talked about it and how it was his favorite book and how much he loved it so I thought that I should ask for it.

So, as I said above, my attention span is kinda short, but I started reading it on Christmas, and finished it at around 3:00 AM. That’s legendary for me. Since then i’ve only really been able to do it with *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk (one of my favorite authors), and now i’m doing it with *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger.

The book was so incredible. The plot, the characters, the overall emotion that it conveyed was something special. And it made me love the movie *even more* because of how great everyone did and how faithful it was to the book. It really captured the vibe perfectly. The guy who plays Percy Jackson totally nailed Charlie, Emma Watson (in my top 5 celebrity crushes) totally nailed Sam, and Ezra Miller really nailed Patrick, but he kinda nails all of his roles (*especially* in *We Need to Talk About Kevin* which is another book I want to read), but i’m getting sidetracked. Books don’t make me cry but I came real close. I already knew what happened at the end, but it was *just* as impactful as when it happened in the movie, and that’s just incredible.

Anyway, I give that book a 10/10 and definitely recommend that everyone reads it. It doesn’t matter what type of person you are, you *need* to experience that book.

I am curious to know the techniques that some of you employ whilst reading. Do you intentionally try to mentally or verbally summarize as you read or is it more a subconscious process that occurs in the background (but perhaps you actively trained the skill when you were younger?)?

Please note that I am aware that the majority of readers have difficulty recalling smaller, insignificant details in a book or article. That is less of a concern.

Out of all the books I have read lately this is by far my favorite but there are some things I would like help understanding or to discuss.

Such as:

**The child with the birthmark on his face that appears to go missing the very next day on the island and the one that planted the seed of a possible ""beast"" being on the island. This was the central point of the idea of fear being inserted into the boys minds. When he was also asked during the first assembly he was silenced by the group and laughed at.**

*What I can't seem to understand is that a book where so much symbolism is found, how does this child not represent ""Ethnicity"" or other nationalities that are different from the boys. Since he did introduce us to the fear or plant the idea that we fear things we may not understand or are like us. He was even silenced and disappeared which I'm not sure if he was killed early or if the fire in the beginning killed him but it seems to me he represents the racial issues we face even today.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Next, One of the things that bothers me is the fact that we never learned ""Piggy's"" real name.** 

*I am not sure what to make of this but it disturbs me that he had no identity and was bullied the entire time on the island.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**During the last few chapters it appears Ralph is very forgetful and can't seem to recall simple things such as the fire or being rescued?**

*Was he losing his mind on the island and part of himself or is it foreshadowing of the build up to show that all logical reasoning is being lost.*

AP is a satirical view of consumerism that has led to self-consumption, all in the name of looking the part and crafting the kind of reality that marketers and advertisers tell us we need in order to be complete. I put it in the same social-conscience stream as Fight Club (which tackles the demasculation of males in today's ever-changing world that tries to say what men should be like, how they should think, how they should speak, etc.).

The quality of Bret Easton Ellis' writing is superbly clear and carries the reader from one page to the next like one of Patrick Bateman's favorite 80's songs by Whitney Houston or Sting. The killing sequences are extremely graphic and horrific, but in my opinion, none of this actually happened -- it was all in Bateman's head, which becomes apparent at the end of the novel when he realizes who he imagined killing was still very much alive. AP has been banned in plenty of countries but to focus on the serial killer aspect is shallow and misses the point this novel is making entirely: most of us aren't individuals, we're actors in a script we didn't write, searching to fill the void that marketers are telling us we have. Life today is a series of carefully constructed social media posts which, in reality, is someone else's highlight reel, and as we work towards making our own highlight reel, we find that it's almost impossible to keep up, because it's all fake BS.

American Psycho captures the essence of modernity, how we define ourselves by the brands we endorse with our hard-earned dollars, and how ridiculous it all is in the grand scheme of things. As for the serial killer part? It's open for interpretation, but in my opinion, Patrick Bateman's homicidal fantasies are his subconscious' way of trying to tear apart the world he finds himself not only trapped in, but which has consumed him in much the same way as we see it consume us.

I dare you to read this book and tell me there aren't characters in it that remind you of someone you know. That's the horrific brilliance of American Psycho. After years of piling through so many books, I truly felt like this was a diamond in the rough and I am currently re-reading it.

&gt;  It’s a culinary catalyst, an agent of change, a gastronomic rock star. Ubiquitous in the world’s most fabulous cuisines, butter is boss. Here, it finally gets its due.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;After traveling across three continents to stalk the modern story of butter, award-winning food writer and former pastry chef Elaine Khosrova serves up a story as rich, textured, and culturally relevant as butter itself.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;From its humble agrarian origins to its present-day artisanal glory, butter has a fascinating story to tell, and Khosrova is the perfect person to tell it. With tales about the ancient butter bogs of Ireland, the pleasure dairies of France, and the sacred butter sculptures of Tibet, Khosrova details butter’s role in history, politics, economics, nutrition, and even spirituality and art. Readers will also find the essential collection of core butter recipes, including beurre manié, croissants, pâte brisée, and the only buttercream frosting anyone will ever need, as well as practical how-tos for making various types of butter at home--or shopping for the best.

Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

&amp;#x200B;

If you recall, a couple months ago I made a post about my school not having a library. The response from you all was amazing- I received an outpouring of generosity and donations, both in a normative sense, and in boxes and boxes of used books.

I love those books; the dog eared pages, scribbled notes in the margins, and ancient library stamps.  They bring history and character to my classroom, and my children know that real people somewhere cared enough to send them books, and their own books at that.  In addition to these well loved, amazing books, your donations allowed me to order an entire classroom set of novels, over 75 different books that range over so many different topics and areas of the literary world.

In an effort to keep this short, thank you.  Thank you a million times over and from the bottom of my heart.

Just finished the last page of The Last Wild Men of Borneo and was sorry to. Such a fine book, but I was most impressed with your 18-day trek with the Penan. That is really deep diving into your subject material that few writers, maybe Sebastian Junger, would undertake. In my younger days as a hard rock exploration geologist I spent a lot of summers in the remote wilds of Northern British Columbia, hiking all day through Devil's Club and thick woods but then of course at the end of the traverse, a chopper would drop out of the sky and take us back to camp for dinner and a beer.

Anyways, I enjoyed Savage Harvest a lot and Wild Men too. Your books make for fine reading.

Dear Oolican,

Thanks so much for your note, and for reading both Wild Men and SH. What I kept thinking during that time with the Penan was that Bruno had done that, lived that, for six years. You get used to conditions that you'd never tolerate at home, of course, fairly quickly, too, but still. Of course, Bruno did go frequently into Long Seridan and other villages, where creature comforts lay, but less and less as time passed and the pressure to capture him grew. Hard to imagine. As for me, yes, I thought about that dinner and that beer just as much as you. 

Anyway, thanks again for your gracious words. 

Best,
Carl ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Hoffman,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a big catch though and I won&amp;#39;t spoil it incase anybody sees this and wants to read the book but he courageously alienates his friends and family and turns himself into a weapon to save humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a ton of twist and turns along the way. T.Ellery Hodge tells a beautiful story about an unassuming boy becoming a man and battling his inner self all along the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a trilogy only book 1 and 2 are out currently but 3 should be coming soon I hope! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve read it lets talk about it! &lt;/p&gt;

There's an author. She's not my favorite author, but she writes solid books with good plots and fantastic dialogue. Really excellent.

Thing is, she just started a spin-off series from her main series. One of the bad guys from the main series is now the protagonist. And I was like... but the things he did in the book are sadistic and unforgiveable, how is he the protagonist now? But whatever, I'll try to give it a chance, I guess?

I start reading it and he gets given a blanket absolution, oh, all the terrible things he did was someone else's fault, there was magic involved, now that magic is gone and left to his own devices he'll be way less evil. Okay, whatever. A little hand-wavy, not sure why you needed to make a story about this guy and then whitewash his past, there were plenty of other dark anti-heroes you could have made the star, but you went with this guy. Fine.

I'm about a third of the way through the book and I can't go any farther. He just got way, way too rapey. This was my first red flag when I first learned he was getting his own book; I've got nothing against dark situations, there's a lot of murder and death in these books, people struggling with how much they love to fight, but this guy always stood out cuz he was creepy af. He got actual sexual thrill from combat, and was frequently shown objectifying women. It was almost enough that I wasn't gonna give the book a chance, at all.

Early in the book, to my pleasant surprise, he notices a woman noticing him, approaches and flirts with her, is given a solid no, and he simply moves on. I was like, okay. I'm not cool with how you were in the past, but whatever. I guess you're just magically someone else now.

This proved to be wishful thinking. I don't wanna spoil anything just in case, but about a third of the way through the book there's a tense argument scene and he seamlessly slips into fantasizing about raping the woman he's arguing with. I sucked it up and read exactly two more paragraphs to see if some explanation came up, if it was some throwback from his past and he was going to react with revulsion to his own dark impulses, if they were going to acknowledge at all that this was a bad idea... nope. Totally natural. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen. Getting hard thinking about how delicious it will be when she tries to fight him off.

I get that the author was going for ""anti-hero."" I'm not unaware of the attempt. But no. Someone at some level in the proof-reading process should have told her that this is not how you anti-hero. Honestly someone should have told her that she burned her bridge with him as a bad guy and not to even try, but literally everyone from her beta readers to her editors who read the rape-fantasy scene and told her ""good job"" failed her.

Maybe I'm over-reacting. Maybe I should have just trusted my instincts and never read this book at all. I feel like now I can't even go back to the main series and re-read it. No part of this is okay at all. Maybe I'm just not dark enough, maybe the problem is with me, but I can't empathize with a main character who thinks it's a good thing to fantasize about rape.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this isn&amp;#39;t the place for this.&lt;/p&gt;

Do you read a lot of reviews before picking a book? After reading it? Do you do book clubs? Are you a celebrity reviewer? I basically just use it to catalog and rate without a review, just to kind of document for myself. I've been thinking about doing reviews but every time I write one I feel like my opinion really isn't that important and there's a lot more well-read people who know about literary theory and things like that.

“Characters Victor: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

Martin’s development of the main character Dunk as an imperfect protagonist wins this category. Before reading the book, I though Dunk and Egg as names for the main characters might make Martin’s whole story a joke. Luckily, I was wrong. Dunk’s attempts to do his best in the world make for better character development than the almost all-powerful Geralt of Rivia. The Last Wish is supposed to be an introduction to Geralt, which it does serve for the basics that Geralt is a Witcher. He’s dangerous, imperfect, and he tries to do his best in the world, but this doesn’t compare to the growth we’re able to enjoy in Dunk’s and Egg’s adventures. The humor Sapkowski places into The Last Wish does add significantly to it and is one of the main reasons I enjoy the stories of Geralt so much.
Plot Victor: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

Martin’s stories provide a better arc to enjoy than Sapkowski’s disjointed and unconnected stories. While Martin has three longer stories, Sapkowski’s is a collection of six stories with a frame story that’s utilized between each of the six stories. A collection of short stories is fine to be disjointed, but the opportunity to use the frame to help the reader wasn’t utilized to its full potential and that penalizes Sapkowski in my review. Sapkowski’s challenge to write about the one main character that needs to fit in the rest of stories is more difficult. Meanwhile, Martin’s characters are never seen again in his books. Additionally, The Last Wish was written before most of Sapkowski’s other works, likely before he could have known the entire saga he was about to write.
Connections Victor: The Last Wish.

Sapskowski paints the scenes for some of the fundamental lore for the rest of his books and CDPR’s games. In comparison, Martin throws a lot of lineage at the reader and not much else in significant connections. The lightbulb moments that went off for me while reading The Last Wish were substantial and I don’t see even a thoroughly knowledgeable fan of Martin’s world to feel nearly the satisfaction of revelations that Sapkowski provided.

...

Final Verdict: If you’ve never read, watched, or played any media in either writer’s worlds, read The Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. It’ll provide a short, fun, and satisfying read. Plus there are some illustrations to enjoy throughout the book. “

Only after getting the help of another writer, Terry Bison did the book actually get completed. And it's a fantastic book on its own, even rivaling it. But that's the problem. It has to be compared to its original.

I feel as if this book was written first, or even another book set within the world that Miller crafted, we would have a while series crafted in this fictional universe. Because that is exactly what Miller created, a *universe*. A world where knowledge is sacred and is used for evil and for good. It is sad that we will never see that world again. And it makes me sad every time I see it on my shelf. I'd love to dive into a post apocalypse that started back at 0 that was driven by the church. 

To anyone who had read the original, I highly suggest the sequel. It took me three times to actually get through it.

Only after getting the help of another writer, Terry Bison did the book actually get completed. And it&amp;#39;s a fantastic book on its own, even rivaling it. But that&amp;#39;s the problem. It has to be compared to its original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel as if this book was written first, or even another book set within the world that Miller crafted, we would have a while series crafted in this fictional universe. Because that is exactly what Miller created, a &lt;em&gt;universe&lt;/em&gt;. A world where knowledge is sacred and is used for evil and for good. It is sad that we will never see that world again. And it makes me sad every time I see it on my shelf. I&amp;#39;d love to dive into a post apocalypse that started back at 0 that was driven by the church. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To anyone who had read the original, I highly suggest the sequel. It took me three times to actually get through it. Mostly due to having to stop and search things up as it deals heavily with how the church works, monks work and nomadic culture. Fictional or not. &lt;/p&gt;

1. Read out loud


2. Read slowly

3.reread a page or chapter as much as you need to.


4. Keep reading even if its not making sense or you aren't retaining it.


5. Try audible it's not cheating. 

I'm 33 years old and I hadn't read a single book (aside from a DMV handbook) in 15 years since I had left highschool. My excuse was always ""I can't retain anything"" and it was true. I could read a whole page and be into what I was reading and as soon as I was done with the page I had already forgot what I had read. I just keep telling myself reading isn't for me. And I went 15 years without reading a book. 

Then one day I kept hearing about this new book and how amazing it was! I knew I couldn't read it but I had to know the story so I broke and got myself and audible account. I bought the book and loved it! All of a sudden I wanted more! I wanted to listen to another book but they aren't cheap on audible and I couldn't wait a whole month for my next credit. I went down to my local thrift store and they had books for just ¢.75! I grabbed one and took it home. I immediately ran into the same problem as before I couldn't retain anything and it nearly broke me. But then I thought to myself why can you listen to a book but not read it? So what I did is I decided to read it outloud to myself as if I was listening to it in audible and that helped a bit.

After finding out that reading out loud worked for me I also realized that reading very slowly also helped. I was finally able to make progress on my book. I did have to go back and re-read a few chapters a few times just to make sure I truly retained what I had just read. Another thing I found out that worked for me was pushing through with any book that I picked up. No matter how stupid I felt not understanding what was going on or even if I didn't understand certain words. I realized that just reading on that a lot of it would just come together and make sense. And after getting through difficult books later on other books would seem like a breeze. 

A year and a half and 20 books later I no longer have to read out loud or very slowly. I just pick up a book and read it. Reading is for me now and I love it. It's my biggest pastime and I'm glad I stuck with it!

Finally, instead of leaving EFL and **getting a real job**, as various people along the way suggested I do, I got a three-book deal with the Orion Publishing Group, a movie deal with Silver Pictures and Warner Brothers and the dissolute bohemian life of a full-time writer. Invitations to work in related fields like comics, gaming, movies and TV started to crop up shortly thereafter, and I try to keep my hand in at all of those too. I still don’t have a real job, and if I’ve sorted out my life to any extent, it rarely feels like it. As the great Joe Walsh says, **I can’t complain but sometimes I still do**.

I have always wanted to read American Psycho, as satire tends to be my favorite type of novel, but was always a little nervous about how violent the book is supposed to be, so I avoided it.

Last week I saw an old interview with Mary Harron and Bret Easton Ellis where Harron jokes about how the novel only has about six pages of violence in it, so I thought what the hell and gave it a shot.

Just finished it today, and I'm glad I read it. I really enjoyed the writing style, and Bateman's narration has really stuck with me the last few days as I was reading. I was able to pretty easily skip some of the more disgusting parts of the novel without missing much, and Harron was right, there isn't THAT much violence in the book, as it seems to come in short, ridiculously over the top, bursts.

The book was honestly pretty hilarious, and I enjoyed the biting commentary. Every time he randomly interjected with what had been featured on The Patty Winters Show, or talk about his Platinum AmEx I would often laugh out loud. 

If anything, I feel like the book could have been maybe 50-100 pages shorter. While I loved the repetitive ramblings about fashion or restaurants or music, it went just past the point of enjoyable into skimmable toward the end.

I think my biggest question is, why did BEE write such violent scenes into a novel that I think otherwise got its points across pretty successfully?

Yesterday I finished a book titled ""Munmun"" recommended to our class by the local teen librarian.  She does book talks twice a year and usually I love every book she recommends so of course I decided to check this out.

I knew right away from reading the book jacket it would be an interesting read.

Because this book is largely a commentary on wealth inequality and capitalism is written from the perspective of an extremely poor and illiterate person, it is also written in the tone of an illiterate person.  Forexample, alot of short phrases are cominbed, sentences are very runon, things ramble, jumpy and see what I mean?  This style takes a lot of getting used to, but is so beautifully and consistently done that it pulls you even deeper into the world of the book.  The only other book that's even come close to doing something this unique was ""Ivory and Bone"" which was written almost entirely in 2nd person. 

As far as the actually story, the book jacket and online basic summaries are also a little mislrading.  They portray it as a story about a littlepoor brother and sister working to get our of their impoverished state.  You would imagine the climax then to be their success and for a happy ended.  Rather, their success comes about 1/3 of the way through the book (sort of, it's a complicated book, you should read it to understand it more fully).  The book is more about the main character Warner struggling with the economic and social systems present in the book regardless of what scale he's at (scale is the book's representation of weath.  The more munmuns you have, the larger you physically are and the bigger your scale).  It's a beautiful commentary/satire, beautiful story, and the most unique read I've had in a very long time.  

I created this post as a thread to hear other opinions about the book from people who've read it.  What did you think of the writing style?  Did you enjoy this story?  I'm just so exacted about the book, I really want to talk about it.

I just finished East of Eden then watched the film. Now I have a strong urge to write the director and ask him what we did to deserve such an atrocity. How can such a complex book with such diverse characters be cut so short? 

Raise your hand if you've been personally victimized by Elia Kazan and James Dean. 

No Lee! No Sam Hamilton! No context with regards to Adam or Cate which inadvertently shaped who they were as people and as parents.

I understand books have to be adapted to film and some things don't translate well but there were a few parts of the novel I was shocked didn't make the cut. Given that the film only covers the 4th part of the book - the real travesty - I figured less deviations would take place. 

For example, I was disappointed that Cal and Adam didn't have a genuine father - son conversation. It's a pivotal point in the book as Adam finally realizes that he isn't any better of a father than his own. He then makes a choice to be a better Father and recognize Cal as not only his son, but a person. In one conversation Adam realizes he wants to know his sons and Cal realizes he loves his father. It was wholesome and I was sad to see it cut but the movie did try and make up for what it lacked.

In the book Steinbeck meticulously crafted his characters but since the movie skipped the first 500 pages it was necessary to create a few scenes. Doing this gave the audience some context of who the characters were and who they wished to be. 

I think the scene with the German neighbor did just this and added a lot to the movie that viewers needed in order to understand the boys characters. In it Aron protected his neighbor as he couldn't understand or accept that people could be so cruel and unjust. Cal jumped out of a ferris wheel to protect his brother because he thought it was good and his guilt guided him. However, Aron chastised Cal for doing this because it was self indulgent of Cal. That rejection made Cal 'bad' which Abra was attracted to because it meant she didn't have to live up to Arons seemingly pretentious 'goodness' which was another rejection, only towards Aron, not Cal. So much in one scene.

If only people watching the movie knew how similar Adam was to Aron. Adam, in his naivety, refused to see bad (specifically in Kate which his talks about with Lee and Sam) but Aron refused to accept bad and it's existence hurt him. However, with age Adam began to see the bad and he felt guiltily for loving Kate. This changed him and he couldn't accept Cals money - surprise, another rejection.

Another part the movie messed up was how Cal saw Cathy. He knew she was missing the ability to see good just as Adam did when he brought her Charles's letter. My mouth fell open when Kate gave Cal money instead of Lee. It was against everything she was because she hated Cal. He saw her insecurities, her fear, her inability to believe people can be good and she hated it.

With this in mind, the story is very well done. In the 660-page tome, Tyson offers his version of the biography of Lovecraft’s legendary Abdul Alhazred, the author of the Necronomicon frequently referenced in the mythos. Late in the text Tyson separates the two names when the title character reveals his name to be Alhazred, but that it had previously been Abdul. This explanation is essential in my view, since the original Lovecraftian name is grammatically incorrect.

The story begins quickly. By the end of the first chapter the main character is mutilated, made a eunuch, forced to consume his own genitals. As the story proceeds he meets various spirits, demons, sorceresses, ghouls, and Cthulhu spawn as he seeks magical knowledge and the power to restore his lost manhood. The story in many ways follows the pattern of mythical coming of age stories for both Alhazred and his young female companion. Here are a few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the book:

•	Early in the story Alhazred is marked with the sign of the outer god Nyalarthotep, a notably dishonorable diety who disdains the other outer gods. While the sign grants him safe passage in many cases, many of the characters in the story recognize it as a kind of brand, marking him as the god’s slave. As a result they are distrustful of Alhazred as they are of Nyalarthotep.

•	Following his banishment to the desert Alhazred joins a clan of ghouls, eventually being accepted by them. It’s at this point that he develops the first and strongest friendship of his life with a ghoul who has himself been banished. The friendship creates lasting change in Alhazred, leading him to embrace his new identity.

•	May of the longest-lived, most intelligent characters in the novel often have only one critical piece of wisdom or knowledge, but turn out to be tricksters or fools in every other way.

•	Chapter 52 is one of the strangest pieces of fiction I’ve ever read.  The book is worth reading just for that chapter.

•	The story begins with Alhazred’s manhood being torn from him by a king, and he fully recovers himself by defeating another king. In the process of seeking the power to restore his manhood, he discovers a more powerful and free version of himself.

The novel is broken into two parts of approximately equal length. The first part describes Alhazred’s journey through the desert of Yemen, across the Red Sea, and up the Nile. The second part details the trek of he and his female companion into Mesopotamia and finally Damascus. The storytelling in part one is well focused. Part two has less focus in the narrative; it can be better described as a series of vignettes and adventures. Tyson incorporates plot twists throughout the novel, but some come off as gimmicks rather than solid storytelling. I found Alhazred to be a fun read, though it only scratches the surface of the Lovecraft mythos. It also contains themes of hope and agency that aren’t found in Lovecraft’s work. I’d recommend this book to folks who are interested in occult fiction, Lovecraft-inspired fiction and the Cthulhu mythos, or weird fantasy in general.

Admittedly I was turned off as it sounded like a less interesting ripoff of Stephen King's apocalyptic epic *The Stand*.

​

But after being unable to settle on a new book to start, I picked *Swan Song* up albeit skeptical of the product. Boy was I wrong. I couldn't put the damn thing down and despite it's size finished it off in a few weeks. Yes, it shares some thematic and conceptual elements of *The Stand* but that's where the similarities really stop. I have to admit I lean towards liking McCammon's work better.

​

Both stories have an apocalyptic event kick starting an epic battle of good and evil in the ruins of America. While I enjoyed the superflu aspect in *The Stand's* first half, McCammon really captures the devastation, confusion, and fear that comes with nuclear war. McCammon's post-disaster villain ""The Man with the Scarlet Eye"" also comes off more menacing than Randall Flagg because he's almost a Lovecraftian unspeakably horrific entity. Whereas *The Stand* establishes the main conflict as a battle in a Judeo-Christian religious terms, *Swan Song* sets it in more magical and mysterious tones.   I'd also give points to the characters of *Swan Song* who by the end I was really rooting for and understood even if they were villainous.

Yes, it shares some thematic and conceptual elements of &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt; but that&amp;#39;s where the similarities really stop. I have to admit I lean towards liking McCammon&amp;#39;s work better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both stories have an apocalyptic event kick starting an epic battle of good and evil in the ruins of America. While I enjoyed the superflu aspect in &lt;em&gt;The Stand&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; first half, McCammon really captures the devastation, confusion, and fear that comes with nuclear war. McCammon&amp;#39;s post-disaster villain &amp;quot;The Man with the Scarlet Eye&amp;quot; also comes off more menacing than Randall Flagg because he&amp;#39;s almost a Lovecraftian unspeakably horrific entity. Whereas &lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt; establishes the main conflict as a battle in a Judeo-Christian religious terms, &lt;em&gt;Swan Song&lt;/em&gt; sets it in more magical and mysterious tones.   I&amp;#39;d also give points to the characters of &lt;em&gt;Swan Song&lt;/em&gt; who by the end I was really rooting for and understood even if they were villainous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could talk all day here but I was curious if anyone here had read both these books. I&amp;#39;d love to hear your thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;

As is true for many authors who were successful in the pulp fiction industry Merritt’s plots and charac-ters were often formulaic. However, Merritt integrated enough unique premises and ideas to make each of his works unique and entertaining.

The most heavily printed version of the story includes the original novelette plus the concluding sequel, The Snake Mother. However, because the story was reprinted so many times several differing versions can be found in pulp magazines and books emerging from 1930 through 1980, with introductory chapters being the most frequent addition to the story.

The hero and main character of The Face in the Abyss, Nicholas Graydon, is in many ways a stock character of the pulp era. A reasonably well edu-cated white American male, thirsty for adventure and wealth, quick tempered, physically courageous though possessing a simplistic conscience, and of course having a strong attraction to young women.

The story opens with Graydon, a mining engineer, being recruited by three treasure hunters to seek Incan treasure. One of the treasure hunters takes a young Incan woman hostage. He attempts to assault her but is stopped by Graydon, who sets the young woman free. The others return and become incensed that what the girl, whom they saw as a ticket to fabulous wealth, was freed. They disarm Graydon of his “automatic” and make him a prisoner during their search for treasure. The woman eventually returns with others from her society, and in a twist, leads the men to a hidden city where they find a trove of gold and jewels. However, the horde of wealth turns out to be under the control of an apparitional dark lord called Namir. The rest of the novel centers on Graydon’s recruitment into a battle against Namir and his allies. A few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the novel are below:

•	While many pulp-era stories contain unabashed casual racism and sexism, it’s not blatantly on display in the Face in the Abyss. In fact, one of the strongest leaders in the story, the Snake Mother, is female.

The Face in the Abyss is a fun read, and gives the reader a few interesting tidbits to think about. Just as importantly, it gives the reader a window into the mindset of many males in 1920s America.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham Merritt’s “The Face in the Abyss” was one of the most heavily read and reprinted novels of the pulp era. As is true for many authors who were successful in the pulp fiction industry Merritt’s plots and charac-ters were often formulaic. However, Merritt integrated enough unique premises and ideas to make each of his works unique and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most heavily printed version of the story includes the original novelette plus the concluding sequel, The Snake Mother. However, because the story was reprinted so many times several differing versions can be found in pulp magazines and books emerging from 1930 through 1980, with introductory chapters being the most frequent addition to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hero and main character of The Face in the Abyss, Nicholas Graydon, is in many ways a stock character of the pulp era. A reasonably well edu-cated white American male, thirsty for adventure and wealth, quick tempered, physically courageous though possessing a simplistic conscience, and of course having a strong attraction to young women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story opens with Graydon, a mining engineer, being recruited by three treasure hunters to seek Incan treasure. One of the treasure hunters takes a young Incan woman hostage. He attempts to assault her but is stopped by Graydon, who sets the young woman free. The others return and become incensed that what the girl, whom they saw as a ticket to fabulous wealth, was freed. They disarm Graydon of his “automatic” and make him a prisoner during their search for treasure. The woman eventually returns with others from her society, and in a twist, leads the men to a hidden city where they find a trove of gold and jewels. However, the horde of wealth turns out to be under the control of an apparitional dark lord called Namir. The rest of the novel centers on Graydon’s recruitment into a battle against Namir and his allies. A few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the novel are below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• While many pulp-era stories contain unabashed casual racism and sexism, it’s not blatantly on display in the Face in the Abyss. In fact, one of the strongest leaders in the story, the Snake Mother, is female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• In the story the overriding desire for money and wealth is used to bring characters to destruction, while motivations like love or knowledge lead to salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• In one of the most interesting chapters of the novel the Snake Mother discusses the similarities between those who are cer-tain there is extraterrestrial life and those who are certain there is life after death. She points out that both sets of believers have powerful arguments but no evidence, and the irony that they often reject each oth-er’s arguments. In this respect not much has changed since 1930.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• The name of the ancient city in the story, Yu-Atlanchi, sounds too similar to New Atlantis to be coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

From what I have seen so far, she had a really fucked up situation growing up. Steve Jobs, while being a millionaire tech celebrity, denied that he was Lisa's father and she and her mother had to live off of welfare. When it was finally proved via DNA test that he was the father, he still denied it and in a Time magazine article said something like 10% of American men could be her father. 

From what I saw in the movies, he seemed to actively engage in gaslighting her Mom, threatening that he has people who can kill her in and instant and he could get away with it. This was only in the movie and not in Walter Issacson's book, but the people who worked on the movie did some very heavy research, even reaching out to Lisa herself, and pretty much everyone who knows Steve said that the movie was a very accurate representation of his character. 

Lisa's Mom seemed to have her own demons too. There wasn't too many details in this situation, but when she was a kid, there was an incident and she wanted to move out her Mom's house and into Steve's. 

Steve says he's remorseful for what he did. But it seems like things weren't happily ever after, and accepted her into her life (though the movie heavily implied that he didn't actually start paying decent child support until he found out she was actually a pretty intelligent person. That he may not have paid more if she seemed normal to him). They still seemed to have conflict, stemming from Lisa growing older and figuring out what Steve had done to her and her Mom. Steve at one point refused to pay Lisa's Harvard tuition. 

In the movie, both Joanna Hoffman and Andy Hertzfeld confronted Steve on the way he treated his daughter. At one point Andy tell's Steve on why he paid her tuition ""I think it's a miracle she's not robbing banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army. There's no reason in the world why she should be nice. But she is. So I helped, because somebody had to.""

I'm just worried that when I finish the book that I will forget all of the important material about him and other people I'm reading on.

This isn't a problem with novels because I read them just to enjoy it, but it might be a problem with this :(

But why is this so rare? Do books targeted at adults take themselves too seriously? Why do books fall behind in playing with our surreal  imagination relative to other forms of media? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any books that could scratch this goofy itch, feel free to list them.&lt;/p&gt;

It tells the story of her survival through the years of the communist revolution and subsequent genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge. While it's written in the first person from the perspective of a five to eight year old child, Vaddey uses the medium to work through her adult thoughts, feelings, and perspectives by placing them into the mind of her main character. A few thoughts I had while reading through the novel:

* The first chapter gives an clear description of her rather sheltered, seemingly innocent life as a member of a royal family. Her father, who works as an intellectual and a poet, seems to carry his own innocence, or perhaps naivete about the society in which he lives
* &gt;!The family's innocence is shattered by the middle of the second chapter!&lt;
* As the family flees fighting in the city and enters the countryside, with revolutionary soldiers as guides one begins to get the feeling that the entire battle for the city and refugee crisis was staged by the Khmer Rouge. The population, particularly the upper class population was tricked into moving into rural camps where they could by physically imprisoned, surveilled, and moved around with ease. 
* It's not for several months before the characters realize they won't be able to return home, and accept the reality of that situation. This meshes with the refugee experiences of other works I have read, notably ""Nobody Waiting"". It seems many people are susceptible to a belief that returning home (possibly returning to youth and perceived safety) is always possible. Even at the end of the story the girl needs to be reminded that there is no home to return to.
* Class consciousness is tied into the novel, as one would expect of a tale that dealing with communism and royalty. And it seems that lack of class mobility reduced the ability of the characters to adapt as the traditional systems by which they had defined themselves were demolished. &gt;!The most adaptable character in the story was the mother, and she had lived as a poor farmer, a villager, and a wife to a prince. Because of this she had skills as diverse as gardening, sewing, the ability to speak French, understanding of literature, an ability to keep secrets, particularly within herself. It's this skill set that becomes more important to survival than all others.!&lt;
* &gt;!Vaddey reveals in the novel that her father had supported many of the ideals of the revolutionaries, but believed they should have worked through the democratic system that existed in Cambodia from 1970 to 1975. He states that he became disillusioned when the revolutionaries embraced authoritarianism and violence, as though their ends could justify any means. However, his response to their imminent threat was to condemn their methods in private conversation, not to demonstrate for democracy, prepare for fighting and survival, or to confront the threat in any meaningful way. Clearly he was not alone in this!&lt;; Cambodia's collapse into totalitarianism and racial genocide was the result of a massive collective error by millions of adult Cambodians, people whose very lives, and much of the meaning of their lives, depended on their social systems and structures. By failing to defend that system they became participants in their own doom.

I found the novel to be easy to read and though provoking.  Vaddey's descriptions are vivid, and her storytelling is powerful. I recommend it to anyone interested in a story of survival under terrifying conditions.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Shadow of the Banyan is part memoir, part autobiographical novel of Vaddey Ratner, the daughter of a Cambodian Prince.

&lt;li&gt;The first chapter gives an clear description of her rather sheltered, seemingly innocent life as a member of a royal family. Her father, who works as an intellectual and a poet, seems to carry his own innocence, or perhaps naivete about the society in which he lives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The family&amp;#39;s innocence is shattered by the middle of the second chapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the family flees fighting in the city and enters the countryside, with revolutionary soldiers as guides one begins to get the feeling that the entire battle for the city and refugee crisis was staged by the Khmer Rouge. The population, particularly the upper class population was tricked into moving into rural camps where they could by physically imprisoned, surveilled, and moved around with ease. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s not for several months before the characters realize they won&amp;#39;t be able to return home, and accept the reality of that situation. This meshes with the refugee experiences of other works I have read, notably &amp;quot;Nobody Waiting&amp;quot;. It seems many people are susceptible to a belief that returning home (possibly returning to youth and perceived safety) is always possible. Even at the end of the story the girl needs to be reminded that there is no home to return to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Class consciousness is tied into the novel, as one would expect of a tale that dealing with communism and royalty. And it seems that lack of class mobility reduced the ability of the characters to adapt as the traditional systems by which they had defined themselves were demolished. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The most adaptable character in the story was the mother, and she had lived as a poor farmer, a villager, and a wife to a prince. Because of this she had skills as diverse as gardening, sewing, the ability to speak French, understanding of literature, an ability to keep secrets, particularly within herself. It&amp;#39;s this skill set that becomes more important to survival than all others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Vaddey reveals in the novel that her father had supported many of the ideals of the revolutionaries, but believed they should have worked through the democratic system that existed in Cambodia from 1970 to 1975. He states that he became disillusioned when the revolutionaries embraced authoritarianism and violence, as though their ends could justify any means. However, his response to their imminent threat was to condemn their methods in private conversation, not to demonstrate for democracy, prepare for fighting and survival, or to confront the threat in any meaningful way. Clearly he was not alone in this&lt;/span&gt;; Cambodia&amp;#39;s collapse into totalitarianism and racial genocide was the result of a massive collective error by millions of adult Cambodians, people whose very lives, and much of the meaning of their lives, depended on their social systems and structures. By failing to defend that system they became participants in their own doom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the novel to be easy to read and though provoking.  Vaddey&amp;#39;s descriptions are vivid, and her storytelling is powerful. I recommend it to anyone interested in a story of survival under terrifying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway I just finished 1984 for the first time. Mandatory mention that it is in fact amazing.

Why the hell does O'brien use SEVEN years doing a sting operation against Winston? Or simply why is Winston special at all? The society seems to have no qualms about vaporizing thought criminals after a single allegation, so why is Winston allowed to be an adulterer and enemy of the Party for so long?

Why bother with the pretense, the book and everything? Does everyone get this treatment? For sure this doesn't apply to Mr. Parson.

The only theory I have is that they want to build Winston up before brainwashing him. It still it seems very excessive and an unreasonable amount of resources must have been used on the operation.

I was reading the post on books that people had given up before finishing and I had a few in mind. I realized that most of them were what I refer to as “Book Club” books. It used to be easy to spot them before the near downfall of physical bookstores but I’m sure that Amazon and other sites still promote them. I’m talking about the books that are usually farmed out to a big publisher’s subsidiary to make them seem less big business. They usually have a visually stimulating cover that’s different from a mass market book: lots of colors and hand drawn images. Often they will have a little symbol showing that they are part of Oprah’s book club, or won some obscure award, or lacking that sport a quote from a famous author extolling their virtues, or at worst say “the author of XY” even if you’ve never heard of XY before. 

They often have reviews saying that they are the “next great American novel” or more probably paid or quid pro quo-ed glowing reviews by more successful authors on the back or even on a display sign in a bookstore. If you’re a lover of books it’s often easy to get pulled in by such an obvious yet supposedly organic marketing campaign. These books are MORE than just a book you can pick up from the bestseller rack of pulp paperbacks. This is literature so you can feel like you are bettering yourself and feel smart when you bring them up to like minded people. 

The problem is a rather large number of them just suck. Now not all of them do. I have read some that I’d put in this category that were fine, some even pretty good. But many in my experience are just part of a simple yet effective marketing strategy as I said above.

One of the worst offenders that comes to my mind immediately is Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugeniedes. I think it actually WAS an Oprah book(I didn’t watch her show) about a young person in Detroit that was born a hermaphrodite. I guess it follows their struggle to find themselves with a bit of Detroit riots thrown in? I’m not really sure...it was long as hell and didn’t seem to have much of a point. Other examples off the top of my head are Life of Pi, at least two books by Jonathan Franzen, The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton, the Kite Runner, and many, many more. I’m not saying that all of these books are bad, and I have to think that some people must like them. I’ve just been burned too many times by pretentious crap that IMO most people buy strictly so they can talk about them in a book club or to make themselves feel smart and well read. They also often focus on another culture or sexuality/lifestyles than what is perceived as the norm so that’s another feather in the cap for some I’m sure. 

So does my thesis have any merit? Do y’all like these books more often than I do? Are you ever taken in by marketing only to find you’ve bought a book that isn’t great? If you’re in a book club does it include a lot of “modern prestige literature” or books that everyone likes? Am I just a tremendous snob? Love to hear opinions on books that fall into my category and about particular books you loved or hated. I might be convinced to try one if the argument is good. 

WaaaayTLDR: I think that the publishing industry puts out a certain type of book and markets them as better than just a bestselling paperback even if they aren’t that good.

So my question is, should I read the other Smiley books first? I’ve read that this one is both a prequel and a sequel to those books so I’m unsure of where to begin. I’m very wary of spoilers so researching makes it pretty hard so I thought I’d ask here.

Does this one spoil things from the other books? Will I even be able to understand what’s going on? Will I be able to enjoy this book on its own terms?

If not, what George Smiley books do I need to read first? All of them? Some of them?

Well, you all talked me into it and at 6:30 this morning I downloaded it while my coffee was brewing. Then at 7:00 I turned on the TV and set my kids in front of it because I was hooked. It’s 3:00pm and I’m 70% of the way through. Dishes are stacked to the brim. Kids are still in pjs. Dogs are bored and glaring at me. Toys are everywhere. My bedroom was turned into a fort/nest.

AND THERE ARE THREE MORE BOOKS!?!?

How will I get anything done? Will anyone ever do the dishes? Will Paw Patrol rot my kids’ brains? Will Ender save the world??? Stay tuned...


Edit: I just stopped to make coffee, do the dishes, and make sure the kids were alive. It made me realize I was doing that scene in Neverending Story where the little boy has a sandwich or something and looks at the storm and hunkers back down with the book. Back to reading!

Edit 2: It’s over, it’s done. What a day, what a story. Back to the old grind. 

Edit 3: for anyone still listening, the Speaker for the Dead book has been started, and is good. Reminds me a lot of the Children of Time book so far. But that one was a single reader and I think this one will be too. Ender’s Game will definitely be a multi-reader. Thanks to my husband who came home early from work because of the holiday weekend and has been parenting since 5 while I engage on this mad quest to do all the reading. 

Edit 4: The Speaker book has gotten pretty good. The piggy/fence situation reminds me of the movie “The Village”.  Thanks everyone for letting me know that there’s like 90,000 books in the series. I’ll definitely read them all! But probably not the same way as Ender’s Game. It’s so rare that a book just surprises you like that.

This scene from chapter 9 in The Catcher in the Rye really stood out to me where Holden Caulfield is in a hotel room looking out the window and looking into other rooms.  In one room he sees a man dressing in women's clothing and in another room he sees a man and a woman spitting their drinks in each other's faces in a sexual way. 

Here is the scene in question, narrated by Holden:

""I saw one guy, a gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on, do something you wouldn't believe me if I told you.  First he put his suitcase on his bed.  Then he took out all these women's clothes, and put them on.  Real women's clothes, silk stockings, high-heeled shoes, brassiere, and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all.  Then he put on this very tight black evening dress.  I swear to God.  Then he started walking up and down the room, taking these very small steps, the way a woman does, and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror.  He was all alone, too.""

He then goes on to describe the couple squirting their drinks in each other's faces.

My interpretation is that the cross-dresser and the fore-playing couple are Holden Caulfield.  This is for a few reasons.  The first being that Holden clearly lies uncontrollably.  He had to keep himself from talking on the train to the lady next to him in order to stop lying.  It seems his narration that he ""saw"" these strange acts could be a lie, especially as it is prefaced by him narrating ""you wouldn't believe me if I told you.""  It seems likely he lies in his narration, too.

Furthermore, the cross-dressing man was a ""gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on...""  This sounds like Holden, who we know has a lot of gray hair on one side of his head.  This man was also alone, as was Holden, and was smoking a cigarette, as Holden had been doing frequently leading up to this scene.

The women's clothing were also described in such detail, it's difficult to believe he actually recognized each article of clothing from a distance.  And the man was looking at himself in the mirror, which brings me to the next scene.

The couples spitting their drinks at each other was Holden doing it to his reflection in the mirror.  Here is the scene: ""Anyway, first he'd take a swallow and squirt it all over her, then she did it to him, they took turns, for God's sake.""

And after that scene, Holden felt aroused and called up a promiscuous girl who's number he had, presumably to try to have sex.  It seems possible these strange acts Holden performed aroused him.

One other thing is that before Holden went to the hotel, he got into a fight with his roommate Stradlater in part because Holden was mad/jealous about Stradlater's date with Jane where they likely had sex.  Holden asked Stradlater if they did, to which Stradlater got on Holden's bed and playfully punched in in the shoulder ""in just his damn shorts and all,"" just like the man in the window.  Holden has previously shown interest in Stradlater's body, so that's just interesting to note.

Any thoughts on this?  I did some googling but didn't find anyone with the same interpretation, which I think is really interesting and compelling.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm asking this as someone who's not a big reader due to ADHD, my brain just refuses to cooperate no matter how much I may want to read something, but even when I do read I tend to read non-fiction as it's easier to digest. I find fiction impossible as I can't read for long and I can't maintain focus on what I'm reading to get into a story, I also have [Aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) so can't imagine what it is being described to me in a book.

Bookworms are into books in a way I don't think I could never understand - don't get me wrong, I love books as I was raised in a house full of books (my mother would spend hours reading, she could easily get through a  book a day) so I was raised to view them as something precious, but stories written within books are like some magical world I don't have access to. I don't understand how people can get so caught-up in the stories.

I hear people watching TV or film adaptations and say 'the book was better' but I have no idea how on earth words on a page could be comparable to a TV show or film, how a book can be so descriptive to be on comparison. I read each individual word, only half goes in, so I just can't see how bookworms see books.

I don't know what to make of this. Has to be fake, right? But if fake, WHY?

The handwriting is a sort of haphazard mixture of small caps, lower case, and cursive, and it looks pretty similar to examples of OJ's handwriting I found online. Also there is no actual signature, only ""The Juice"" crammed in the extreme lower right corner. It's possible OJ (or whoever signed it) ran out of room for a full signature.

Very strange.

Etsuko and Seiji Ogata were totally into each other, and still are. They want each other so bad. Jiro probably knows or senses it at some level.

No, really, I could make that case.

A) Etsuko introduces Ogata to us by first dwelling on his physical attractiveness, comparing him most favourably to Jiro. Let this sink in for a moment. If a guy were to start telling us about how sexy his mother-in-law was compared to his pudgy dowdy wife, well, God bless you please, Mrs Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you can know!

B) Their banter is of such a flirtatious nature that surely others have had the same notion I hold. Naughty words about withholding favours or doling out punishment while actually going the extra mile for him. Ribbing him about his ugly name. Him reciprocating by making fun of his own ugliness. If they were to ever get down to hot and heavy things it'd be kinky as all get out. Real potential for light BDSM dynamics here.

C) The azaleas. With the way that scene is constructed in the novel, the subtext of attachment, mutual desire and attraction, and repressed emotion is so strong that I think the azaleas got fertilised by their pheromones. There is the sense of finality in the way Ogata describes ""the day it was all finally decided. That you and Jiro were to be married"". That final decision caused Etsuko to make the wild presumptuous demand for a house with ""azaleas in the gateway"" if she was to live there, a demand Ogata complied with without delay. Subtext: ""if what we feel cannot be openly acknowledged, I must have at least a tacit symbolic acknowledgement. Give it to me, or I won't agree to this alternative socially-acceptable arrangement."" And Ogata is so obviously hurt by her momentary failure to grasp his reference to the azaleas, when he is standing by the window making it hard for Etsuko to see his expression. She doesn't need to, though. The mere use of this narrative contrivance tells us she knows full well the unspoken conversation they are having.

And more: she disavows the decision made by Jiro to move out into their own apartment. She knows that decision caused hurt. For her own part she wanted to stay, at least under the same roof as Ogata. Ogata's simple response of ""No"" is him giving her absolution for the moving out. This is some forbidden Sweet May Chill December love story right here.

D) ""Yes,very guilty. I wonder what Father gets up to when there's no one to keep an eye on him."" Oh wouldn't you like to know, Etsuko, wouldn't you like to know. 

2. The missing black silk tie. Ogata probably took it and was contemplating hanging himself, when he didn't come out of the bedroom that morning. Etsuko was disproportionately relieved when she called out and he answered, aftee Jiro had gone. The unspoken un-narrated thought must have occurred to her.

3. The use of international chess rather than Go is not, after all, on account of Ishiguro not being familiar with Go's mechanics, but because he really did want the somewhat quaint metaphors made possible by the mechanics of international chess. Instead of ""rook"", Ogata says ""castle"" - players don't usually use that term to describe the playing piece (albeit ""castling"" is a move), but here the effect is that the idea of a castle's fortifications is an apt metaphor for Jiro's attempt to stonewall his father regarding Shigeo Matsuda. Likewise, Ogata refers to the knight as a ""horse"", which frankly seems a bit odd. Here, however, it serves as a kind of metonym for travel, departure... Ogata is saying, in effect, that Jiro's decision to move out was ill-considered. Lots of things are happening in that scene of course, but the particular terms Ogata was using caused me tl change my mind about why the author chose to deploy chess rather than Go.

&lt;p&gt;D) &amp;quot;Yes,very guilty. I wonder what Father gets up to when there&amp;#39;s no one to keep an eye on him.&amp;quot; Oh wouldn&amp;#39;t you like to know, Etsuko, wouldn&amp;#39;t you like to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missing black silk tie. Ogata probably took it and was contemplating hanging himself, when he didn&amp;#39;t come out of the bedroom that morning. Etsuko was disproportionately relieved when she called out and he answered, aftee Jiro had gone. The unspoken un-narrated thought must have occurred to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of international chess rather than Go is not, after all, on account of Ishiguro not being familiar with Go&amp;#39;s mechanics, but because he really did want the somewhat quaint metaphors made possible by the mechanics of international chess. Instead of &amp;quot;rook&amp;quot;, Ogata says &amp;quot;castle&amp;quot; - players don&amp;#39;t usually use that term to describe the playing piece (albeit &amp;quot;castling&amp;quot; is a move), but here the effect is that the idea of a castle&amp;#39;s fortifications is an apt metaphor for Jiro&amp;#39;s attempt to stonewall his father regarding Shigeo Matsuda. Likewise, Ogata refers to the knight as a &amp;quot;horse&amp;quot;, which frankly seems a bit odd. Here, however, it serves as a kind of metonym for travel, departure... Ogata is saying, in effect, that Jiro&amp;#39;s decision to move out was ill-considered. Lots of things are happening in that scene of course, but the particular terms Ogata was using caused me tl change my mind about why the author chose to deploy chess rather than Go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I'm Mary Robinette Kowal and I have three unrelated careers. I'm an author, a professional puppeteer, and an audiobook narrator.

My short fiction is sort of all over the speculative fiction map. My novels are science-fiction or fantasy. (So far.) The first series, The Glamourist Histories, is sort of like Jane Austen with magic. Then I did Ghost Talkers, which is set in WWI with ghosts and mediums and spycraft and stuff like that. But you're probably interested in the Calculating Stars, which is book one of the Lady Astronaut duology. Oh! And if you want to read free stories, [I have some on my site](http://maryrobinettekowal.com/fiction-collectio/online-fiction/). I’m also a member of the Hugo-award winning podcast [Writing Excuses](https://writingexcuses.com/).

So there's also the puppetry. In high school, I was doing puppetry as a hobby, but I went after an art degree, minoring in theater and speech. While performing as Audrey II in a performance of Little Shop of Horrors, a professional puppeteer came to the show and I was like... ""Wait. People actually pay you? To do this?"" And pretty much changed career paths on the dime. I went on to intern at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA. With over twenty years of experience, I have performed for LazyTown (CBS), the Center for Puppetry Arts, Jim Henson Pictures and Sesame Street. You got questions about puppets? I got answers.

For the audiobook stuff, I'm a member of SAG/AFTRA. As the voice behind several audio books and short stories, I've recorded fiction for authors such as Neal Stephenson, Cory Doctorow and Seanan McGuire. And my own books, too. It's sorta like puppetry, without the pain.

I live in Chicago with my husband Robert and, at current count, nineteen manual typewriters.

And now random stuff -- I lived in Iceland for year and a half, working on the show Lazytown. Two cats. I'm obligated to mention the cats, right? I include a Doctor Who cameo in every novel. 

When I say that you can ask me anything, I really mean it. I’ll talk about everything from hand-sewing period costumes, to shoving my hand up things, to writing, to depression.

Especially with the hardships the master goes through in trying to publish his book about Pontius Pilate within the story, and the emotional toll that it takes on him.  

There are several stories that comengle and touch on one another but the main plot line is about the devil arriving in Moscow and what happens afterwards.  The terms of good and evil are examined and played with. This book can be comedic, and tragic all at once.  Bulgakov does a wonderful job mixing in humor with darker subject matter which will make you laugh and cry.

Bulgakov's writing will keep you immensly captured by his story.  I love all the people you meet along the way and the events that you sit in on!  I absolutely loved his characters, especially Woland! 

Did The Master and Margarita make you think of your own sense of good and evil?  Do you think Bulgakov was drawing parrelles between the master in his book and himself living in the censored Soviet Union?  Did the ending sit well with you and do you think he was making commentary on living under such harsh conditions?  This is such an amazing book, if you haven't  read it I highly recommend it.  If you've only read it once I would suggest giving it another read!  Definitely one of my favorite books in general, especially from a  Russian author! 

One of my favorite quotes from the book:

""The tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes never! You're asked an unexpected question, you don't even flinch, it takes just a second to get yourself under control, you know just what you have to say to hide the truth, and you speak very convincingly, and nothing in your face twitches to give you away. But the truth, alas, has been disturbed by the question, and it rises up from the depths of your soul to flicker in your eyes and all is lost.""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The translation I read was from Burgin and O&amp;#39;Conner.  The Master and Margarita is a very powerful and sometimes pointed read that definitely illicited a wide swath of emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

I’m currently almost done with The Warded Man, and I just finished reading about Leesha’s rape. This was kind of the final straw for me for this book and I wanted to hear some other people’s thoughts because I know this is a pretty popular series. 

I’ve had issues with the way Brett wrote Leesha from the beginning. He seemed to present her as this girl that was constantly crying and weak, and spent a weird amount of time and detail describing her and Gared’s hook up when she was literally only 12, which was really gross to me. I do appreciate her growth as an extremely competent Herb Gatherer and she did grow up quite a bit, but I find it really frustrating that she kept up her habit of crying at the first sign of inconvenience or danger rather than maybe expanding on her skills as an Herb Gatherer and drawing strength them. I kind of feel like that this is just some kind of personal fantasy that he’s projected on Leesha of this beautiful girl that’s incapable of taking care of herself and has to rely on other people constantly, and I’m hoping that I haven’t made it far enough in the series to see her fully develop as a character. The way he’s written her up to this point just really turned me off to this series to the point where I’m questioning if I want to finish it. 

In general, I have an issue with how much rape is used as a plot device in fantasy books. Before anyone lays into me for this, I understand that the time period and setting for most fantasy books is in a time where rape was very common, but I just don’t understand why it’s so vital to so many plots. Leesha’s just seemed so crude and unnecessary, and Brett only seemed to use it to drive the point home that she’s fragile and needs someone to take care of her. 

I’d love to know if this is how it continues for the rest of the series because I really do enjoy the story, but I just can’t handle how Brett is writing this character that has so much more potential than a simpering wallflower. 

Without going into detail and also as something I’d like to not focus on, I’m a victim of sexual assault and I try to make sure that that isn’t something that influences my life and other experiences I have. Because of that, I’d also like to know if anyone else gets the sense that women in fantasy go through some shit, or if this is just something I’m more sensitive to and is something I can work on.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all.

That's how I first heard of it. I read it over the past week and it's an excellent gothic novel, I definitely want to read more of Waters' novels after this one.

I had an interesting theory about the ""ghost"" in the story after finishing it and wanted to get some discussion about it.

Towards the end, Caroline suggests that the ghost may actually be a poltergeist caused by Rod's mental stress. In parapsychology a ""poltergeist"" is generally thought to be psychic energy created by a living person, not the spirit of someone dead.

I think the poltergeist is actually Dr. Faraday.

Faraday has always been fascinated by Hundreds Hall - in the beginning, he tells us about when he broke off a piece of the molding as a child, since he wanted a part of the house for himself, even if it meant damaging part of it. His marriage to Caroline at the end seems to have the same selfish goal - what he really wants is to inherit the house, and he disregards her happiness and mental state to get it.

I think Faraday is unaware he's causing anything to happen (typical of poltergeist cases), and genuinely is a skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. But the events caused by the haunting are serving his subconscious desire to remove the Ayres family and take the house for himself.

He's born from a lower class and, as a doctor, he's a self-made man who strives to be like the wealthy upper class but doesn't have the ""old money"" background like the Ayres. The house probably represents that to him, and he makes reasons to stay with the family (as their doctor) so he can be there as often as possible, and eventually gets the idea to marry Caroline (but I think all she really represents to him is the house).

I think a subconscious part of Faraday hates the Ayres family for not taking proper care of the place. Rod and Mrs Ayres already have unstable mental conditions, but I think they actually did witness supernatural activity. Their condition just made them more susceptible to it, and then Faraday can diagnose them as unstable and seems almost eager to get them out of the house.

I didn't really think of Faraday as the ""antagonist"" of the novel until he started pressuring Caroline to marry him, but really all throughout the novel he's working to get Rod and Mrs Ayres to get committed to institutions, he kills Gyp ""because it's the right thing to do"", and generally manipulates Caroline so that they can marry and (more importantly) he becomes the owner of the house.

And in the end, when Hundreds Hall is abandoned (partially because of the ghost stories), he still has the key and still goes back to ""maintain"" the empty house. He's also unaffected by the ghost, despite how much time he spent in the house. The final paragraph suggests he was the thing haunting the family all along:

&gt; If Hundreds Hall is haunted, however, its ghost doesn't show itself to me. For I'll turn, and am disappointed - realising that what I am looking at is only a cracked window-pane, and that the face gazing distortedly from it, baffled and longing, is my own.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume there&amp;#39;s probably some of you reading this book, since the movie adaptation comes out tomorrow.

I just finished The Road by  Cormac McCarthy  a few days ago, and against all the critics and the Pullitzer Price that it received, I didn't like the book so much. 

I know the book is very special, by the facts that they are no chapters, the characters are totally disincarnated (no name, very few physical description), no informations on where does the story take place, on the past of the world or on his future, etc. 

I know that it was intended by the author to make it the more universal story possible I think, but it keeps me emotionally  out of it, I didn't get attached to the characters or to the world. I don't discredit the author at all, Cormac McCarthy have a huge writing talent, of description and atmosphere, it's really impressive. But at the end, I feel like there not much a story in there, that's it's way too much philosophic and allegoric for me, except for two or three moments. 

There are a lot of people who enjoy the book, there are some who had the same experience as me. What do you think of The Road ? 

And also my other question is, The Road is the first Pullitzer Winner book that I read, are they all like that ? I've not a very high reading level, I would say I'm an average reader, should I avoid Pullitzer Winners ? Or was this a misluck experience ?

At all. 

Though I do love to read, I never could force myself to sit down with *To Kill a Mockingbird* or *Jane Eyre* outside of a school setting. For whatever reason, renowned literary classics all seem to have a really long, really boring introduction at the beginning in which nearly nothing happens except the characters are introduced in the most ‘tell-not-show’ way possible. And even though the books are - obviously - old, and will therefore have an older writing style, I just couldn’t find the strength to plough through it. Heck, I even struggled reading *Anne of Green Gables*.

I figured, for a long time, that I just wasn’t a classics person. I would never be in the upper-class of the literature world, but instead be forever confined to the looked-down-upon YA books that I somehow never grew out of. That aspect didn’t really bother me; why waste time reading something *slow* and *boring* when I could be reading about a teenage half-dragon princess leading a rebellion against her own kingdom (or something?) without the convoluted writing style or depth that many classics seem to have (that inevitably flew over my head)?

Well, I’m here to tell you that I was wrong.

My friend recommended *Emma* to me on the one condition that I would read it. All of it.

I recognized the author, but apart from that, that’s all I recognized. To give you an idea of how detached I was from the literate elite, I thought Pride and Prejudice was about *war*. 

You can imagine my confusion when *Emma* was...also not about war.

I’m not going to lie, the first chapter was *rough*. As soon as I read the first sentence - “Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, blah blah blah...” I thought, *oh boy. Here we go.*

But...I actually really liked it. 

Even though the writing style was old, it didn’t *feel* old. In fact, it read like a modern romantic comedy. Emma’s antics were actually pretty funny, and one scene especially - in which Emma literally pries her shoelace off and chucks it into the bushes as an excuse to give two characters more alone time - made me laugh out loud. I usually hate romance novels, but I would actually go as far to say that Jane Austen’s books are probably the only kind of romance that I’m able to stomach.

At one point, I remember thinking, “*This* is what people are so excited about?” I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t what I expected at all: it wasn’t full of messages I didn’t understand or weighed down by language or any of those things. It was just fun. 

That being said, I absolutely understand why it’s highly regarded - Austen has a way of creating characters and situations that are completely timeless and authentic, as well as providing a glimpse into the social climate of the 1800s. 

I definitely encourage anyone who’s never had a taste for classics to give this book a try. There are a couple things I would recommend, however, rather than jumping in blindly:

**Get a copy that’s annotated,** or at the very least has footnotes of some kind. Mine was an Oxford copy that I got from the library, and the definitions and historical context notes at the back were so, so helpful when reading. Otherwise, I never would have known that shaking hands were only reserved for close friends, or that calling someone by their first name was considered highly disrespectful if you didn’t know them personally. It really helps you understand what you’re reading. However, *don’t* read the introduction until after you’ve read the book. It contains a whole bunch of spoilers.

**Keep track of the characters.** A ton will be introduced at the beginning, and many of them will be important later. I started writing notes on them but later stopped when I became used to remembering who’s-who. Also: DO NOT look up any character maps or notes online, because you WILL run into spoilers. :( That’s why it’s good to use an annotated edition, so the notes are right there and you don’t have to search around in the angry abyss of the Internet for them. 

And finally, **you will get used to the prose after a while.** The old style annoyed me at first, but now I can’t imagine the story being told any other way. 

Anyway, that’s all! Because I liked *Emma* so much, I’m probably going to read *Mansfield Park* next (although I’m scared that it won’t measure up!!) ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a big ‘classics’ reader. At all. &lt;/p&gt;

I usually hate romance novels, but I would actually go as far to say that Jane Austen’s books are probably the only kind of romance that I’m able to stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, I remember thinking, “&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is what people are so excited about?” I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t what I expected at all: it wasn’t full of messages I didn’t understand or weighed down by language or any of those things. It was just fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I absolutely understand why it’s highly regarded - Austen has a way of creating characters and situations that are completely timeless and authentic, as well as providing a glimpse into the social climate of the 1800s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely encourage anyone who’s never had a taste for classics to give this book a try. There are a couple things I would recommend, however, rather than jumping in blindly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a copy that’s annotated,&lt;/strong&gt; or at the very least has footnotes of some kind. Mine was an Oxford copy that I got from the library, and the definitions and historical context notes at the back were so, so helpful when reading. Otherwise, I never would have known that shaking hands were only reserved for close friends, or that calling someone by their first name was considered highly disrespectful if you didn’t know them personally. It really helps you understand what you’re reading. However, &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; read the introduction until after you’ve read the book. It contains a whole bunch of spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep track of the characters.&lt;/strong&gt; A ton will be introduced at the beginning, and many of them will be important later. I started writing notes on them but later stopped when I became used to remembering who’s-who. Also: DO NOT look up any character maps or notes online, because you WILL run into spoilers. :( That’s why it’s good to use an annotated edition, so the notes are right there and you don’t have to search around in the angry abyss of the Internet for them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, &lt;strong&gt;you will get used to the prose after a while.&lt;/strong&gt; The old style annoyed me at first, but now I can’t imagine the story being told any other way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that’s all! Because I liked &lt;em&gt;Emma&lt;/em&gt; so much, I’m probably going to read &lt;em&gt;Mansfield Park&lt;/em&gt; next (although I’m scared that it won’t measure up!!) &lt;/p&gt;

The first time I noticed this problem was through my reading of Stephen Kings ""IT"". 300-400 Pages through the book I was really invested in it and thought the story awesome. But then a scene happened, in which a woman was abused by her violent boyfriend, that brought me to a stop. I just couldn't read further. My stomach hurt every time I thought about those scenes and all the previous emotions of joy were now just in disgust. The same feeling happened in some other books that were recommended to me.
 
There is no problem when I watch violent movies or play bloody videogames. When something graphical is happening in this media I normally think to myself ""oh fuck that was intense"" but when I read those passages in books it's more like ""meh there is no joy in this, it just hurts"" 

My fear is to misjudge books by this flaw of mine. For example I almost stopped reading the game of Thrones series because of the Sansa pov's.

I know that quite a few posts already exist, but I didn't feel like I could just put my comments onto an old thread and I'm also wondering if someone might be able to help me out with studying the book. I read it in a paperback version from the library, but I'm going to immediately buy the digital version so I can highlight and write notes the second time around. Does anyone have any suggestions for reading guides or discussion groups for this book? 

I've read a few of Steinbeck's other works (Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, The Grapes of Wrath, The Pearl) and while I appreciated them, none of them had nearly the beauty or impact that ""East of Eden"" did. I started reading it because of all the recommendations here on this sub and I just finished it less than 20 minutes ago. I spent at least 7 hrs. reading in the past 2 days, I just couldn't stop. 

I've read a lot of novels I'd been told I should love and haven't. I've read countless classics that were just a chore. This was an experience that I wasn't really prepared for, even after all the glowing reviews. I didn't skip a single word. I never found myself scanning or skipping paragraphs. I was simultaneously rabidly jealous of Steinbeck's mastery of words and imagery as well as deeply sad that he's gone. I can't count the number of times I read a sentence or paragraph two or three times in a row, just to savor it. I know there's more of his work that I haven't read, but I want MORE than that even. Hope that makes sense. 

For me, the commentary on cycles, on life and death, were more impactful than the good vs. evil themes. As a middle aged woman, reading about people confronting their mortality head on was refreshing and reassuring. I couldn't even BEGIN to list my favorite lines, but this paragraph hit me like a ton of bricks, "" “I’m a nosy old man, Adam. And the sad thing to me is that I’m losing my  nosiness. That’s maybe how I know it’s time to visit my children. I’m  having to pretend to be nosy a good deal of the time.”""

I can already feel the beginnings of that in myself, even at 41. I'm not on the cutting edge of technology anymore. I don't know who all the new, popular musicians and actors are. I don't want to spend hours just sitting around, talking about other people. I don't understand ASMR or why kids think it's satisfying to watch soap being cut! I've lost a lot of my nosiness already. That paragraph felt similar to the descriptions I've read in other books about very old vampires just losing interest in everything before walking into the sun. 

On a different note, Lee is by far my favorite character. I laughed out loud quite a few times at his dialogue. His tragic back story absolutely took my breath away. 

Alright, I think that's all I have to say before I really put a lot of energy into studying. I can't wait to see how much I consciously noticed and subconsciously picked up on.

The book is said to be the inspiration for Phantome de l'Opera. But is more so a study in Bohemia.


The book is wordy, onerously so. The author takes a page and a half for what could be conveyed in one sentence. The text almost seems pretentiously written. It makes frequent allusions to authors, artists of the time. It made me feel clever and intelligent for recognizing names and stupid all at once for not being able to appreciate the metaphors.


The lengthy paragraphs are made worse with the heavily salted French interspersed at about once per page. I'm familiar with some French, but was using Google Translate for about half the phrases. 


Throughout, the author is reminiscent of France, putting himself on the periphery of the characters. He expounds on rues, boulevards, venues, and restaurants. This first hand account requires the reader to have a knowledge of Paris either before or during reading.


The characters are thoroughly examined. Their portrait studies can go for pages. So then, their actions can become predictable. Nothing really seems to happen for the first half of the book. We are thoroughly introduced to Billie, the Laird and Taffy. I admit, I got the Laird and Taffy confused in my mind. The author reminds each time about the characters traits so that you can remember who it is that's doing the action. The other main characters, Trilby and Svengali make a believable interaction. Their periphery friends are inconsequential.


There seems to be a lack of action on everyone's part. I can't remember the word, but Billie's mother acts as pro and antagonist. That's when things get rolling, in the second half of the book - and ever so slowly still!


This book got great reception when released. I'd say because it was in the papers as a French tourist advertisement.


I'll give du Maurier this: the lengthy descriptions are artfully written. When taking in a saturated paragraph at a time, it would be easy to linger in the subtleties and allusions of each one.

A great read overall! But I’m curious why Ellis chose to title it after this Elvis Costello song. Obviously the title refers to Costello’s 1977 song from the album My Aim is True. And Imperial Bedrooms in turn refers to Costello’s 1982 album Imperial Bedroom. 

Costello’s “Less Than Zero” lyrically refers to the British neofascist and racist Oswald Mosley going on TV attempting to deny his hateful actions. This rightfully pissed Costello off, and I understand reading the song on that level. 

But I’m unsure how lyrically Costello’s song relates to Ellis’s novel, if at all. Maybe Ellis simply listened to a lot of Costello (Clay has a Costello poster, Blair and Clay used to listen to Costello’s records). Does Costello’s music evoke an aesthetic fitting of the novel and its themes? 

When I think of 80s music, I don’t really think of Costello. Ellis’s later reference in Less Than Zero to Randy Newman’s ironic “I Love LA” makes more sense to me.

I don’t know that much about Elvis Costello or his music, or the 80s music scene, so I’m curious about why Ellis was inspired to name both novels after Costello’s music. Maybe someone on here can explain why?

It is just like the equivelent of a fan who reads too many books (thrillers, fantasy, science fiction, comic, or even Shakespearian works), and becomes anyone he wants to do, just like Don Quixote. These examples of who would they become would include:

\- Becoming a detective or a professor but in reality, it is impossible to proof it to the police, nor they would allow you to teach history, or even investigate a crime scene.

\- Becoming a wizard or a sorcerer, but in reality, there is no magic in the real world and he would not be like Harry Potter, or Lord Voldemort.

\- Becoming a jedi warrior or a space captain, but, again in reality, the fans of Star Wars and Star Trek would call him crazy if he is imagining a spaceship in the sky.

\- Becoming a comical woman like in most 50s shows, but in reality (why do i keep saying it over and over again?), There is no way to become one unless you are hired by the three or four networks like NBC, CBS, ABC, or The CW, in order to be part of a show (alas a sitcom).

\- Or even becoming each or one of the characters from William Shakespeare, those include Romeo and Juilet and Hamlet (which they are the most famous works from him).

Those are the examples of a big fan that would become those that i have pointed out to you.

Speaking of the 4th example, i will say this, Don Quixote is the medieval version of the sitcom I Love Lucy, the reason?

Well, because DQ is episodic, some people read every chapter of this book as a episode (either as a sitcom or a satrical series), and they would take a break for now and come back for after, later, or even tomorrow, so that they can treat it as a series.

Also, just like DQ, I Love Lucy has humor as well (which those notable examples include Lucy testing Vitametavegamin in the first season's well known episode, Lucy and Ethel in the candy factory fiasco in Season 2's Job Switching, and so on and etc.).

I can also compare between Lucy and Ricky Riccardo and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, but with differences. Ricky does the drums while Sancho rides the ass (which is technically a donkey) and worked for the goverment in the second part, and Lucy works as his housewife, wanting to become a star, while Don Quixote becomes a madman, trying and wanting to right the wrongs of the world.

That is why DQ is the medieval equivelent of I Love Lucy, and i wonder if you can compare Miguel De Cervantes's novel with anything that you remembered or watched in recent years.

NOTE: I have Tom Lathrop's version (which is a translated version of the original 1605 and 1615 versions of the book), but i still want to read Edith's translation before his take.

I haven't read anything else by Tart, but after hearing good things about *The Goldfinch* and that it won the Pulitzer in 2014 and will be getting the movie treatment, I thought I'd be sold on this book. Turns out it was actually one of the most frustrating reads I'd experienced.

Many people have compared the book to a modern-day Dickens novel, but anyone who has said that must have read very little Dickens. One of the best parts of Dickens' stories is that they all feel very tight and complete -- most actions have direct consequences and most characters that are mentioned end up coming back and playing a key role, typically in part due to a twist. Dickens often also used his books in order to provide a commentary and critique of the contemporary moment in which it was written.

Compare that to something like *The Goldfinch.* Characters are introduced which have no real meaning or influence on the plot despite seeming important. In fact, almost every character is like this. The doorman at Theo's original apartment, Pippa, who Theo falls in love with (despite having no real chemistry) and who just rejects him throughout the book, the entire Barbour family who disappears in the final act (including Theo's fianceé Kitsey who he just leaves in the middle of their engagement party and then never talks to again for the rest of the book). I could go on, but there are so many loose threads that just don't end up with any conclusion, let alone a satisfying one. The only character who comes back in the end in a significant way is Boris, who I admit is at least pretty interesting.

Boris' arrival and the climax of the book, however, reveals the entire main conflict driving the story to be a contrivance. The painting that Theo steals and then feels guilt for saving for much of his life is merely returned for a large sum of money and no one gets in trouble for stealing it... Something that should have been done *ages* ago. It makes no sense and makes everything feel hollow.

When the book finally does end, rather than wrapping things up in even a remotely neat fashion, it pretty much just has Theo ramble on for pages about his depressing outlook on life, wherein Tart seems to be trying to give the audience her grand life advice, which is to say, there is no real life advice worth giving. It was incredibly disappointing and made me come away from the book with no real lesson learned (of which there could have been many). I suppose she may have been going for a Prodigal Son-type story with Theo and Hobie, but it's a bit of a reach.

I know I've been very critical of the book here, and not all of it was bad. But I just cannot fathom how a book with this many issues and this poor of writing won a *Pulitzer* and got compared to *Dickens* consistently. Anyone else feel similarly?

The doorman at Theo&amp;#39;s original apartment, Pippa, who Theo falls in love with (despite having no real chemistry) and who just rejects him throughout the book, the entire Barbour family who disappears in the final act (including Theo&amp;#39;s fianceé Kitsey who he just leaves in the middle of their engagement party and then never talks to again for the rest of the book). I could go on, but there are so many loose threads that just don&amp;#39;t end up with any conclusion, let alone a satisfying one. The only character who comes back in the end in a significant way is Boris, who I admit is at least pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boris&amp;#39; arrival and the climax of the book, however, reveals the entire main conflict driving the story to be a contrivance. The painting that Theo steals and then feels guilt for saving for much of his life is merely returned for a large sum of money and no one gets in trouble for stealing it... Something that should have been done &lt;em&gt;ages&lt;/em&gt; ago. It makes no sense and makes everything feel hollow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the book finally does end, rather than wrapping things up in even a remotely neat fashion, it pretty much just has Theo ramble on for pages about his depressing outlook on life, wherein Tart seems to be trying to give the audience her grand life advice, which is to say, there is no real life advice worth giving. It was incredibly disappointing and made me come away from the book with no real lesson learned (of which there could have been many). I suppose she may have been going for a Prodigal Son-type story with Theo and Hobie, but it&amp;#39;s a bit of a reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;ve been very critical of the book here, and not all of it was bad. But I just cannot fathom how a book with this many issues and this poor of writing won a &lt;em&gt;Pulitzer&lt;/em&gt; and got compared to &lt;em&gt;Dickens&lt;/em&gt; consistently. Anyone else feel similarly? Or am I in the minority?&lt;/p&gt;

I have a few theories on the book, if you have read it too and understand it better, can you tell me if any of this is correct or maybe can explain it better?


**Warning this next part contains spoilers.**




---------------------------------------------



(Spoilers!)


&gt;!**Theory #1**:
The main character is depressed, and to cope with such depression has recessed into the deep wells of his mind. Recreating within' it the world around him. But all of the characters in his mind are just figments of his own consciousness and as a result they do not, they cannot love nor show emotion back. They simply *are there*, playing back responses, interacting with him. **The Town** offers him this comfort, a tranquility free of rejection and free of all of the mishaps of life. His **Shadow** is his real self, dying away but yearning to experience life. However the **Gatekeeper** is his depression, severing the ties between the two and keeping him locked away in his own downwards spiral. At the end, when he lies back in his car it is to my best guess that he then takes his own life.!&lt;

---------------


Now normally I'd go home with this theory, but then I can't help but feel this story is a double-edged sword and slices two stories in one. Here is yet another theory of mine.


--------------------------------------------------------------


(Spoilers!)
&gt;!**Theory #2**: The main character lives in distant future that has been consumed by war, fed up with devastation **The Town** was created. With its creation it sought to solve humanity by separation of **The Mind** (emotions, memories, drive, etc). Without this, there would be no more conflict and The Town would live peacefully forever. So what is **The Shadow** then? Take this with a grain of salt, but I believe in order to live within' The Town one must become an android. Functionally identical to your real self, flesh and all, experiences consciousness, pain, and might even live forever. But with it comes a price, you are split in two, and you feel no emotion as an **Android**. Your **real self** is really **The Shadow** and your Android then goes on to live in The Town. Since you cannot really experience emotion, only figments of emotion, you rely on your shadow. But as a shadow is only human, it will die, taking with it memories, emotions, and everything that matters.!&lt;


----------------------


&gt;!Why did I come up with Theory #2? The Gorilla with a human brain and a quote from the protagonist himself ""Was this body really mine?"". Along with several other key lines in the book that point towards this being a real possibility. Of course both theories are nowhere *near* perfect so bear with me.!&lt;

The way he is self aware, yet perfectly explains the thought process of someone with anxiety. Wishing you could maintain eye contact with someone and then get mad at yourself when you're always the first to break it. Thinking everyone around you must see your flaws as you do and so you separate yourself from them as to not inconvenience them with your presence all while being envious of their acceptance of their own flaws. Holding grudges for years against someone who likely doesn't even know you exist just because they inconvenienced you. The way he jumps from subject to subject because your thoughts are always scattered.

​

Then the sense of entitlement. Since your anxiety controls you, a social life doesn't exist or the relationships are short lasting and so you resort to reading. Because you're so well read and everyone is off being social, you assume you're more intelligent than everyone else.  Which snowballs the anxiety because you can't imagine socializing with someone who isn't as enlightened as you. You have to maintain this facade because it's the only positive thoughts you have.

This book is hitting close to home because I went through similar feelings during my 20's and into my 30's. How could people do that to ME? How dare they be disrespectful to ME! Everything everyone does is intentional because everything I do is intentional. The reason people don't get me is because I'm just too enlightened.

Took me a long time to realize I'm not that important and anything I thought I've done doesn't mean shit.

No one is going to remember the tons of hours I spent crafting arguments on social media and getting SO worked up and then deleting the comments because I worried about how people portrayed me. No one cares and people don't think about me as nearly as much as I think they do.

So I'm on a Neil Gaiman marathon right now and I'm just going through the books that I currently have. I recently finished ""American Gods"" so I was still in the mood for more Norse-esque storytelling. So I decided to read this book next and I was not disappointed. I knew little to nothing about Norse Mythology (other than the Marvel movies, but even then they change A LOT of things), I thought this was real user-friendly and Gaiman really simplified it in a way that was both interesting and captivating. I could not put this book down, if I wasn't in school or at work, I'm reading Norse Mythology. I started the book roughly a week ago and I can't believe how fast I got it done. It was so bizarre yet fascinating, so strange yet satisfying. By far, Loki is my favorite character in all of Norse Mythology but not for one second would I have my back turned on him.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I can't wait to keep reading more Gaiman books. Last time I checked, the next one on the list is Anansi Boys. Also wanted to know what did y'all think of Gaiman's Norse Mythology? Where would you rank it in Gaiman's standard of writing?

Or even something like *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer, which is of course sci-fi, but also falls in pretty well with a lot of the staples of Southern Gothic and is in the American South, but I'm sure it's also a question of whether or not Southern Gothic makes up a substantial enough portion of the authors work to lump them in with that genre.

“We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we really are.” 
 - Sirius Black, “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.”

“Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.” 
“Walk the paths of logic. Every outcome has its cause ... every predicament has its solution.”

I'm currently studying and doing some research into 'New Adult' and whether or not there is an audience for it. It's books that are aimed for people who read YA but older in terms of 'voice' and 'tone'. When a 17yo is sobbing her heart out over her first break-up - yes, it's world-wrecking and I'm going to read it.

But what about your second heartbreak? Or your third? What about the 22 year old rogue taking on the king and taming dragons?

I think there's a growing dissonance between Young Adult and Adult literature. Young Adult was defined as transitional between Children and Adult but I'd argue that it has become its own category of itself. I love that it spans genres, I still love YA - but I'm wanting more than first love/fifteen year olds taking on the king. I love Adult - crime, romance, fantasy, history etc - I'm all over it - but I'm also looking for that section after ""high school"" but before ""family"" or ""settling/putting down roots"".

I've just finished Assassin's Fate by Robin Hobb, after slowly working my way through the entire Elderling Universe over the past year or so. I often see Robin Hobb applauded as one of the finest writers in the world of fantasy at the moment, and she's quite unusual from a series-style perspective due to the fact her series follow intertwining characters over a number of separate 'cycles'.

I suppose what's prompted me to write this post is that I personally haven't particularly enjoyed the Elderling Universe, and I'm struggling to put my finger on why. Reading reviews for the books once I've finished, and seeing reviews on here, shows that the majority of people seem to be raving about it, but I truly don't understand why.

Spoilers ahead.

Let's start with the Liveship Traders. I wasn't too fond when I first read this, however found it stood up much better on a re-read. Out of the Elderling Universe, I probably enjoyed this one best, including the characters. While it's a lengthy series, it generally had enough going on to keep it interesting. My main dislike of the series, and an issue that I have with all of Hobb's books, is that she spends all this time developing her villains, then dispatches them in unbelievably unsatisfying ways. Kyle Haven, who was probably one of her most relatable villains, was killed off in the middle of a battle by accident, without ever facing comeuppance for what he'd done to his wife and family. It upset me that she'd spent the time building up the character and developing him in increasingly worse ways, only to get rid of him conveniently with no real closure. On a positive note, the development of Althea and Malta as characters was very satisfying and thoroughly enjoyable. 

Moving on to the Rain Wild Chronicles, which is the main 'related' series to the Liveship Traders. By far the weakest of the entire universe, this series read like a bad YA outing (coming from someone who doesn't mind an occasional foray into the YA group). Unbelievably repetitive and dragged out into four books, the entire thing was about who would mate with who and who should be in charge of the pairing. That aside, another decent villain, Hest Finbok, finally reaches a stage where a good stand off should be imminent, and gets eaten by a dragon which nobody else sees happen or knows about! It was maddening.

Onto Hobb's main event- the life and development of Fitz and the Fool. A bastard prince &gt; turned kinda-assassin &gt; whining man and a character-swapping prophet who uses the other to change the events of the world. I stuck with the series, I really did, but just found it to be one disappointment after another. 

Contrary to the majority of opinions I seem to see, I really did not like the character of the Fool. He consistently used Fitz with often zero explanation as to why, and acted like a petulant child when Fitz (rightly) became frustrated with him. The other, main side of his character is Amber, who appears as a character mainly in the Liveship Traders series. I found her to be even worse, in the sense that she had all of the Fool's worst traits with seemingly no nice ones. 

In terms of Fitz, he consistently manages to make his situation worse through the entirety of his life, with only a few short respites. I don't think I've ever read such a downtrodden character. He makes multiple poor decisions the entire way through then sits feeling sorry for himself for the majority of the time. Again, his story is very repetitive and the get swathes could be cut out with no actual loss to the plot of the main story.

Specifically about Assassin's Fate, as it's the final book in the instalment and the one that's prompted me to write this post, I rarely feel so deflated at the ending of a book. The entire three books of this series focus on Fitz trying to build a relationship with his daughter, followed by trying to rescue his daughter from a situation that the Fool has put her in. The Fool in this series was infuriating- considering that Fitz is supposedly his closest friend and his 'other half', he repeatedly hurts him with no regard for the effect that he's having. The main thing that stuck out to me was his complete disregard for Fitz's feelings when insisting that Bee is his daughter; it felt uncomfortable and needless. Assassin's Fate was interesting in the sense that it brought together characters from each area of Hobb's Elderling Universe, and to some degree I enjoyed the way she tied the characters in. But some new characters seemed incredibly unnecessary to add, and the book dragged on for far, far too long. 

As per my previous comments, the actual rescue of Bee and destruction of the Servants and Clerres was the build up for three books, then over within maybe 30 pages. What?! The reader doesn't even see the majority of the finale because they're bystanders! 

In relation to the ending itself, Fitz returns to the place that his King, Verity, dies at the end of the final book after carving and putting his awareness into a stone dragon. Fitz begins to carve his Wolf, after his Witted companion Nighteyes, with the intention of doing the same as Verity as he's slowly dying from a poison administered by the Servants. I guess I saw the ending coming from a long way off, but it doesn't stop it being any less upsetting. I just can't believe that the entire final series is one frustrating mess after another, only for Fitz to die without seeing any of the benefit of what he's done. 

I'm sure that to anyone reading this, I come across as absolutely hating Robin Hobb as an author and everything she's ever written. I'm keen to stress that I don't; I wouldn't have continued with the universe if I didn't believe it had potential. However I feel like I was constantly sticking with it because I was thinking it would get better, and just found that it didn't. I felt that on the whole, with the exception of a couple that I really enjoyed, it had potential to be fantastic but in reality it was only...okay.

The four potential mothers met as teenagers and all had the potential to become pregnant.  Potential spoilers beyond this point.

​

I'm about a third of the way through and, so far, I think the book is about freedom, specifically the freedom after the second world war, specifically in Europe, specifically for women, and specifically for these four women.  So far, I've seen Maxine and Judy's stories.  The former opens her own business, becoming more successful than her husband, and I love their relationship.  It's balanced; she spends so much of her time in charge that it makes sense that their relationship balances that out sexually, with him being more dominant while she is more submissive.  Because of the open talk of sex and sexuality, the book became famous and was also dismissed as a 'bonkbuster', as women's fiction ('chicklit'), and a precursor to novels like 50 Shades of Grey.  I admit, I haven't read the latter, but from what I've heard, *Lace* has a more accurate and more responsible portrayal.  It's loving and playful.

​

Judy works in the fashion industry, which underwent a massive boost after the wartime rationing was reduced.  Suddenly, women who had been cutting down their husbands suits had money and freedom and designers had fabric to play with.  Again, the growth of this industry in post-wartime reflects the post-war freedom of women, as they expanded into new areas and had the option of having careers alongside or instead of husbands.  Her designer friend says to Judy, at one point, (paraphrased, cba to find the quote) ""We did think you were young, but you could be in charge of a little baby at 23, so why not a little business?"".

​

The four potential mothers were born into a world where women always had careers (again, war), where it was normal to live outside the home.  They didn't know, as little girls, that that was new and unusual.  It reminds me of a section in Geri Halliwell's biography, when she describes where 'girl power' arose from.  For English women born in the '70s, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and a woman was on the throne.  They didn't know it wasn't normal for women to be in charge.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;^ that&amp;#39;s the line that closes the first chapter of Shirley Conran&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Lace&lt;/em&gt;.  In the 1980s, four successful career women are invited to meet with a young actress, ostensibly for something to do with their careers.

I think I took 4 or 5 days to finish it, but I think this book is best savored rather than binged.

I loved every single page of this ridiculously well-written story. Characters floored me. Dialogue floored me. The *story* floored me. I don’t give a singular shit if the historical accuracy isn’t there; I’m an American and I read this strictly as fiction. In my eyes, the people who write off this book because they disagree with King’s interpretation of the assassination are fools.

And dear God, that ending. Yeah, I’m a guy who sheds tears a lot—I mean a *lot*—while reading or watching. Just recently, I probably cried during like 3 or 4 movies. And during this book, my cheeks were soaked during the performance of *Of Mice and Men.* It was such a heartwarming and simultaneously heartbreaking moment. Maybe I’m wrong, but I also saw it as a little foreshadowing for this ending. Now, for the ending itself. I didn’t cry at all. I have no idea why. The opposite of George, I was dry-eyed in those final pages but not so during the rest of the book. It was so weird, I can’t explain it, especially considering that the ending was incredibly heartbreaking and should bring anyone who resonated with this story to tears.

This is the best book I’ve ever read. Now that I’m finished with it—it’s the morning after—I have no idea where to go next. I know I’m going to read another one of King’s books, but just the thought that there won’t be another chance for Sadie and George will haunt me for a while, I think.

Just going over in my head, how a movie adaptation of a certain book would look like if a certain director directed it. I have a few suggestions:

**The Glass Jar** - *Greta Gerwig* It would probably play out like a darker and slower, less extroverted version of Lady Bird.

**The Secret History** - *Vince Gilligan* He's never directed a movie before and I might be biased, being a huge fan of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. And I have heard that Donna Tartt doesn't want it to be adapted, ever. But hey, one can dream.

**Norwegian Wood** - Sofia Coppola. Yes, I know there is already an adaptation of this one. Yes, I know not all her movies are great. Yes, I know I'm once again biased because Norwegian Wood is one of my favourite novels and Lost in Translation one of my favourite films. But imagine if she goes back to the tone of that LiT, instead of her more recent works. Having it take place in New York, maybe even present day. That'd be awesome IMO.

**The Never Ending Story** - *Hayao Miyazaki, or just Studio Ghibli in general* Fuck the attention span of children, this movie should be over three hours long. Imagine. IMAGINE!

Anyway, what books would you like to see adapted, and by which director? Be creative and unexpected. The movies don't need to be very similar to the books even. Let your imaginations run free!

I just turned 14 and last Christmas, I got *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*. in that year I had read *Watchmen*, *Divergent*, *Between Shades of Gray* (another AMAZING book), and *Fahrenheit 451*, but not much else. I used to be a really big reader (like, 4 books at once), but Reddit and my phone have absolutely *obliterated* my attention span, so normally, getting into a book is kind of a big deal for me (sorry for the massive run-on sentence). I still love to read, but normally, I can only do r/nosleep and r/shortscarystories type stuff (mad respect for the folks that put out stuff over on those subreddits).

So anyway, I had asked for *The Perks of Being a Wallflower* for Christmas because I’d seen the movie a couple years before, and *loved* it. I remember that I had asked for the book a while back, but at the time, my mom wasn’t totally on board with me reading it (love you, u/YourMamaIsLovely). My language arts teacher that year (a *fantastic* guy) had talked about it and how it was his favorite book and how much he loved it so I thought that I should ask for it.

So, as I said above, my attention span is kinda short, but I started reading it on Christmas, and finished it at around 3:00 AM. That’s legendary for me. Since then i’ve only really been able to do it with *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk (one of my favorite authors), and now i’m doing it with *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger.

The book was so incredible. The plot, the characters, the overall emotion that it conveyed was something special. And it made me love the movie *even more* because of how great everyone did and how faithful it was to the book. It really captured the vibe perfectly. The guy who plays Percy Jackson totally nailed Charlie, Emma Watson (in my top 5 celebrity crushes) totally nailed Sam, and Ezra Miller really nailed Patrick, but he kinda nails all of his roles (*especially* in *We Need to Talk About Kevin* which is another book I want to read), but i’m getting sidetracked. Books don’t make me cry but I came real close. I already knew what happened at the end, but it was *just* as impactful as when it happened in the movie, and that’s just incredible.

Anyway, I give that book a 10/10 and definitely recommend that everyone reads it. It doesn’t matter what type of person you are, you *need* to experience that book.

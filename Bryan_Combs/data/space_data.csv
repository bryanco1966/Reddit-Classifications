"State of the Subreddit: Flairs, Spoilers and CivilityWell met, fellow Trekkies!

It's been a while since we've had an update and with DSC's return beginning to ramp up, we thought we'd do a quick reminder and refresher of some of the rules of the sub for those of you who are new or are curious to the direction we're trying to steer the U.S.S r/startrek in.

First of all, expanded guidelines for all of the rules can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/wiki/guidelines). It's always worth checking that page out, especially for the list of types of posts we will remove.

-------------------------

**Spoiler Policy**

Some of you may have noticed that we relaxed the spoiler policy somewhat during Discovery's downtime. Maintaining a robust spoiler policy in the age of livetweets is always a struggle, especially when it's for a show as talked about as Discovery -- everyone wants to share exciting tidbits from behind the scenes, as well as their theories and exciting things coming up. We want to encourage this, but at the same time we're aware that not everyone wants to know what's going to happen. As a team it's a topic we often discuss at length. Once Discovery's first season was over we decided that we could safely assume that within a month or so of the season ending, the majority of dedicated fans will have watched it, and we could relax the policy a little.

Now that we're beginning to drift into the nebula of speculation and hype for season two, **we will be once more asking everyone to make sure that you utilise the spoiler system for any and all season 2-related spoilers in thread titles, and any season 2 spoilers in comments of posts that aren't directly related to season 2** (i.e. if you wander into a general thread and want to talk about something coming up in season 2, you should use the spoiler tag; if you're in a thread specifically discussing season 2, you don't have to).

In terms of what ""counts"" as a spoiler, we are willing to hear your thoughts. So far we've been assuming that anything which requires effort to find out (i.e. watching a trailer, reading an interview, attending a panel, etc) constitutes a clear spoiler, and anything which has been revealed through general advertising for the show (i.e. characters appearing on posters) isn't.

Generally, we just ask that you be sensible and thoughtful of your fellow Trekkies who may not want [plot point] spoiled, and err on the side of caution at all times.

**edit:** This also includes the 'Short Treks'!

-------------------

**Civility and Wheaton’s Law**

As some of you more regular commenters may have realised, the tone of this sub and Reddit in general has become a lot more (to put it simply) divisive over the last year or so. For us this has meant dealing with more and more discussions very quickly becoming heated and stepping over the line from “a polite disagreement” into name calling and offensive comments.

We want this sub to be a fun and welcoming space for fans to share their thoughts on Trek. That is the bottom line. This is why we invoke Wheaton’s Law, or “don’t be a dick”. We will be continuing with this philosophy going forward.

Some of you have flagged that there have been a number of political posts on the subreddit recently. We do not have a problem with this, provided the post is grounded in a discussion about Trek (as opposed to just invoking an actor or character’s name to make a reference), or if we feel it’s a message which will prompt useful discussion for the subreddit. We’re not going to pretend that we can stop everyone talking about politics on the sub -- as much as we might want to, it’s a bigger job than the team is currently willing or able to handle, nor are we comfortable controlling people’s conversations to that degree -- or that Trek itself is apolitical. We’re happy to monitor these kinds of discussions, but we won’t be dictating what you can and can’t talk about, so long as it generally loops back to Trek in some way. 

Ultimately, we are not a politics sub and we do not want to become one, so if we see political discussions taking over we reserve the right to remove them as needed to keep things Trek-related.

------------------------

**Season 2 Plans**

For DSC season 2 we will be following the same format as season 1 as it seemed to work well and was generally well received. For those new to the sub, this format will be in the form of a pre-episode discussion posted a couple of days before the episode airs, a live discussion post once the episode has been released, and a post-episode discussion which will remain up for a few days to allow everyone to talk about what happened.

The previous Discovery discussion threads can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/wiki/discoverydiscussion).

We will have all of the links and episode info once it’s announced in the sidebar of the sub (in both old and new Reddit formats) as usual.

Depending on how and in what format the “Short Treks” will be released in December we may just have a single live/discussion thread for each one, or a single post for all four.

----------------------------

**General Sub Stuff &amp; Post Flairs**

We’re super excited to have recently hit 170k subscribers! We average 50k pageviews per day and it’s awesome to know you’re all out there and enjoying this shared Trekkie space. We have a few ideas of some exciting things we’d like to implement over the coming months, but please comment if there’s anything you’d like to see on the sub.

We've also implemented some **post flairs**! You can add these to your posts to help categorise them and improve everyone's browsing experience. It's not mandatory to flair your post, but we to strongly encourage it!

The current available flairs are: 

* news (for anything that could be considered news on Trek shows/movies/franchise-related stuff)

* discussion (any kind of Trek discussion/questions/thoughts)

* fun (for silly nostalgia posts or anything that doesn't fit in the above two categories)

* live thread (for mod use only, when the live threads start again)

* announcement (for mod announcements)

* tribbles (for notifications of outbreaks)

Also, if you’re using the new Reddit format hopefully you will have noticed some fun little additions like photos of various Trek crews in the sidebar. 

Don’t forget to also check out our sister subs over at /r/risa (for all of your Trek meme goodness) and /r/DaystromInstitute (for intense discussions about nacelles or something).

"Thanks to Star Trek for making me feel like human again.I watched ENT, TNG, currently on DS9 season 2

There is so much wisdom in every episode of all the series. The content creators did work on star trek with passion and good intentions.

DS9 is slow paced and I absolutely love it. 

I just wanted to say that this is beautiful and I will cherish this forever. Watching star trek gives me rays of hope. One day, I will introduce it to my children and spread the positivity :)

Also, Please share your favourite quotes :)

"Episodes to show an Ethics major?So I’ve recently started watching TOS for the first time and I absolutely love it. I’ve talked about the show with a friend of mine who is an Ethics major this semester and I’ve seen parallels in the material that they’re learning and the show itself. As a general question to those of you who have seen the series a lot, are there particular episodes throughout the series that raise particularly striking ethical and moral questions that someone like my friend would take interest in?

Let's pretend the last Star Trek Series we had was Voyager, after that came only the movies we know and thanks to the new Movies that raised interest in Star Trek again, CBS decided to produce a new Star Trek series, which is this time a prequel about the beginnings of Starfleet and the Federation: Star Trek Enterprise.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we have just seen the Pilot of the brand new Show which is the same ENT pilot that exists in real life, with 2018s special effects but the actors, their looks (let's assume they where just born later and are now at the age they where when it aired in the early 2000s) and the tone and looks of the show are the same.

You guys told me DS9 was even better and now I've gone and done it! I like it that they developed everyone's character and gave them each a compelling story. Also, it makes the 1st episode of VOY so much more interesting. Wish they would bring the DS9 characters back in a movie!",0

"What are everyone’s thoughts on Star Trek: Federation?Star Trek: Federation was a rumoured sixth series in the prime canon which was rejected in favour of Abrams reboot.

From what I remember, it was set a few decades (maybe a century) after Nemesis about a Federation who’d grown complacent in peace and lost its spark for exploration and advancement.

The story would essentially revolve around an alien race invading the Federation and forcing them to adapt to this new threat.

What are people’s thought?

Is it a better idea than the reboot and subsequent Discovery or did you prefer the reboot?",0

"Just showed my boyfriend the Wolf 359 episodes of TNG. His response: 'Meh. Not impressed.'So I'm a lifelong Trek fan, and have finally been inducting my boyfriend over the past year or two. We're on Season 7 of DS9 (we started on Season 3, for obvious reasons), and we're on Season 3 of Voyager. He really likes both.

We're getting to the point in Voyager where they're encountering the Borg, and my bf was having trouble understanding why the crew was so freaked out at the prospect. So I decided it wouldn't be a bad move to show him how the Federation almost got their asses handed to them last time.

Now, he had never been impressed with any TNG episodes he'd seen before (he just finds the characters uninteresting) so I was curious to see what he would make of these ones. Well, I've successfully made him less excited for the Borg :-/ Whoops.",0
"Re-watching TNG with my girlfriend, who had interesting questions concerning encounter at farpointMy first post here :)
So last week I finally watched encounter at Farpoint with my girlfriend, after starting everywhere else in TNG (completely my fault srry).

She liked the episode and understands Q's curiosity with mankind and is charmed by DeLancies portrayal of the character. We noticed Troi in an actual uniform, without the cleavage and saw a spaceborne entity love affair.


Here is where she noticed the following; All nice this story, but how did Groppler Zorn and the Bandi turn the spaceborne entity on the planet into farpoint station? And how did they manage to communicate to the creature whilst the enterprise crew was unable to do so.

I was unable to answer these questions, maybe you guys could help me with this answer?",0
"TOS REWATCH: ""The Enemy Within"" (Spoliers Maybe?)Believe it or not, have never seen this episode, so this is where the ""Horned Dog"" thingy came from. 

So why can't they send a shuttle down for the landing party? I'm guessing it's because it hasn't been established that the Enterprise has shuttles yet? 

Also, I'm only 5 episodes in and I think 20 people have been killed so far....",0
"The Iconians and season 2 of DSCSilly speculation follows...

I was killing time on Memory Alpha, [reading about the Iconians](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Iconian), and was surprised to note the couple of references to this race on Discovery. Does anyone else find it odd that a species that only ever had one TNG episode devoted to it would get two easter eggs in DSC?

Then I got to thinking - maybe they were laying hints or seeds for future storyline, and maybe the last of the Iconians are a key player in season 2. Their ability to travel instantaneously seemingly anywhere might be explained by the Mycellial network, and they fit the profile of the mystery race alluded to in the season 2 trailer. 

Of course, by the time Picard and co. reach Iconia, they're supposedly the first of Starfleet to reach, so any earlier contact would contradict this. Contact on Discovery would have to be explained away as top secret, or covered up by the likes of Section 31.. 

How would you feel about resurrecting this race?

"Starship Mission Objectives?I'm aware of the Enterprise's mission(s), "". . . to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before"", but I was wondering; are these actually *orders* or are they more like a general assignment? More specifically, does Starfleet literally tell the Captain and Crew of such a large and expensive Starship to essentially wing it in the vast unknown regions of space? Furthermore (though, I doubt anyone knows the answer to this), what would the presence of an alien species as dangerous as the Borg mean to Starfleet Command? I understand that part of Starfleet's mission (even though it may not be blatantly stated) is to encounter such species, as to provide some kind of warning to the Federation as a whole. It seems to me that after such an encounter with the Borg, *someone* at Starfleet would argue in favor of *reigning in* such deep exploration, for fear of an encounter with something even worse. Lastly, keep in mind, obviously I don't expect a sure answer on some of the questions I asked. But I was just curious on what anyone else thought. ",0

"Watching DS9 s06e24 Time's OrphanThis episode... Part of me wants to skip it, but mostly because I'm never ready for how much it hits you right in the feels.   


Sure, there's a sort of reset button at the end, but Miles &amp; Keiko still went through their whole ordeal and remember the older Molly. They even wonder if the older Molly knew that she was erasing her own existence by sending young Molly back through the portal. Clearly she wasn't completely erased and just became a sort of paradox.

"I just finished tng and am starting ds9 but my trek may be coming to an endMeeting Brent Spiner at a convention convinced me to watch tng and holy moly I'm in love with star trek now even started playing star trek online. After watching the amazing finale of tng I booted up ds9 after hearing mostly good things but man it was almost painful to watch. The acting felt amateur except for Quark and O'Brien. A bad sign when a ferengi is the highlight of the pilot episode. I'm disappointed as I really like the universe but coming after tng it's jarring and feels like a cheap spinoff. Will it improve? Is it just awkward beginnings? Should I maybe skip it and watch voyager?

"Appearance of Sisko in new Picard series/any other post nemesis showsJust finished watching DS9 for the first time after falling head over heels for it, and was wondering whether the return of Sisko could be shown in the new Picard show, or any potential post-nemesis shows.

"Finished TNG, started DS9 and I wonder if I should continueTNG impressed me. I watched it over the last one and a half years and I really enjoyed the methodology employed by the crew when approaching new phenomenons or managing outer or inner conflict. Furthermore, against TNG episodes I could measure my own ethical believes.

I hoped that TNG and DS9 would work like the seasons of The Wire, where each season examines a different institution. But until now (season 1 episode 11) instead of expanding the scope of TNG to a multi-cultural space hub, DS9 feels to me like a subpar soap opera.

Furthermore, in the first DS9 episode, I watch O'Brien trying to use a cardassian transport, screaming ""Damn it, what's the problem"" and kicking it out of frustration, et voilà, the technical problem is solved. That was appaling and I considered giving up on DS9 already at that point.

Should I skip DS9 or do you think I will get some joy out of later episodes?

Update:
Thank you all! I will continue watching for now!",0

"What are your favorite Enterprises?Over all the incarnations of Star Trek we've had through the decades, we've had quite a few different Enterprises. I was wondering which ones are your favorites? To make it interesting, I'm splitting them up into three groups. You have your TV Hero ships (NX-01, TOS-era 1701, and the Ent-D), your movie Heroes (1701-Refit, the Ent-A, and Ent-E, Kelvin-verse Enterprise), and finally your alternate histories/random one-offs/etc (the Ent-B, Ent-C, Discovery-era 1701, STO's Ent-F, the Ent-J, the assorted Mirror Universe versions, etc.) Pick one from each category and tell why you like that particular one.

&amp;#x200B;

In my case, I actually prefer the NX-01 for my tv pick as the Akira-class is one of my favorite non-hero ships in all of Star Trek, so getting a show's hero ship to look so closely to one was awesome. I also love how ""real"" the technology feels, being so close to what we have right now. It honestly feels like what our first starship would actually be like.

&amp;#x200B;

For films-heroes, I gotta go with the Connie-Refit as seen with the Enterprise-Refit and the -A. While the Sovereign-class is my favorite hero ship class, the Constitution-Refit is one of the rare occasions where a redesigned and updated ship design may actually surpass the original. TOS's Enterprise is a beauty, to be sure, but the movie version is just about perfect in every way.

&amp;#x200B;

For the miscellaneous/one-offs I'm leaning towards the Enterprise-B. While she was a joke of a ship in Generations, the Excelsior-class is such a beautiful design. I'm still not sure if naming an Excelsior-class the Enterprise was a bit of revenge against Scotty for what he did to the Excelsior in ST-III, but it was a fitting choice as the Constitutions were being phased out.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think? Favorite TV-Hero, Film-Hero, and other. ",0
"I just thought of a great idea (I think so, at least)I'm watching a mini doc about the making of Star Trek: The Animated Series, and I never watched it as a kid because I dislike the animation style. But it looks like most of the original voices were there.

A few weeks ago someone posted a clip of Star Trek Continues with a tech that overlayed the faces of Shatner and Nimoy over the actors. I thought it looked great, but the voices were so different, I just couldn't suspend disbelief.

How about this: Get the STC crew to shoot live action versions of the animated series, and use the face tech and voices from the series, and finish out the show.",0

"Star Trek: Legacy - Was this Originally the Planned Sequel to Nemesis?Some useless speculation here that I nonetheless find interesting enough to discuss with you fine people:

I know that there were plans at one point to produce a fifth and final TNG film. Reportedly, this film was going to farewell the TNG cast and bring together a lot of historical elements from the Trek franchise. Of course, the poor commercial performance of *Nemesis* more or less killed that notion.

But I just realized that very basic outline resembles *Star Trek: Legacy* \- the video game that was released in 2006 during the 40th anniversary of Trek. It includes voice-overs from Archer, Kirk, Picard, Sisko and Janeway across their respective time periods.

Do you think it's possible that the outline for the *Nemesis* sequel served as inspiration for *Legacy*?",0
"In TNG’s “A Matter of Time” Dr. Rasmussen enters Data’s quarters to ask questions and steal more things.

Conjecture as to why Data would have two props worn by a hologram in Lt. Barclay’s personal program?

"What is a small stakes story that could work as a Star Trek movie?One of the main criticisms of the bad Star Trek movies is that they feel like big budget episodes. Generally the stakes have to be big for the movies, like saving earth or some other planet with billions of lives at stake. 

Is there a smaller stakes story that could work as a ST film? I remember the original concept of Star Trek: Insurrection was a Heart of Darkness-homage of going up the river for a rogue Starfleet officer. Even the finished movie had a relatively small stakes story of saving 600 civilians but that movie got the usual ""it felt like a big budget 2 parter episode"" criticism.",0

"Sometimes I really wish that Moonves gave Netflix the rights to Star Trek!And no, not because I already had Netflix! I don't care about paying for AA to watch Discovery but I do think Netflix would've had a much grander vision for Star Trek in general. 

I been catching up on Netflix Marvel shows the last few days and although I'm an MCU fan, I have been slacking with some of the shows lately. But seeing just how DEDICATED Netflix has been to Marvel really says a lot! 

That channel was original suppose to only make five seasons of Marvel shows: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist and then The Defenders that they came together in. And that was the original contract. But then Marvel realized they had a hit on their hands and has gone much more farther with it not only creating multiple seasons for all the shows but then added Punisher when he was a big hit in DD. 

Outside of the MCU films themselves Netflix has created their owned shared universe within that universe. And it looks like it's not slowing down. They produced their first show in 2015 and now they have made nearly 100 episodes between all the shows and when DD season 3 premieres. 

Just IMAGINE if CBS gave Netflix to make a Star Trek show back in 2015. Where would it be now?? Maybe NOT five shows lol but I imagine they would've done something similar, invent several shows at the same time, maybe one a year and connect them. They may had gone a lot bigger with creating shows in multiple eras. They may have even done a TNG continuation show or just a brand new show post-Nemesis.

It's just no telling. Now I know CBS has the same plan but I honestly have a feeling it's more reactionary than having a bigger vision from the jump. I'm excited of AA may do, definitely the Picard show, but others so far sound veeeeery iffy IMO. But we'll see and maybe some of those will change.

But man, I think Netflix would've gave us the Trek universe so many of us crave!",0

"Which Star Trek episode or maybe it’s a movie?Hi there, 

I have this vague memory of a scene and I’m trying to figure out if it’s a Star Trek episode or a movie... let me know if it triggers any memories... this might be like humming a part of a song I don’t remember and being tone deaf... 

Here goes:

Like Star Trek, there’s this federation of planets ( a bunch of aliens that look like humans from different parts of the universe) of sorts... this particular group is responsible for helping new species of intelligent aliens ( which I thought all more or less looked human) transition to the larger universe... like a welcoming party... I feel like not all planets get invited.. or maybe it was that some take longer than others to evolve?  Anyways.... I thought it was earth that wasn’t quite ready for its humans to be welcomed yet ( which doesn’t make sense for Star Trek because I thought they were the founding members of the federation?...unless it’s a parallel universe / alternate reality thing). Although I think the earth humans were getting engaged because either their time was running out? Maybe they were going to be hit by an asteroid? Or maybe they were about to wipe themselves out with a war? Or they accidentally made contact with the larger universe? I want to say that the welcoming party committee people had the ability of wiping their memory if they didn’t feel it was time to bring them in... and I also thought I remembered they sometimes intervene to help different planets every so often.

Idk... I’m pretty sure I didn’t make this up and I saw it somewhere.",0
"Paramount/CBS crossover contentSome people seem way too worried especially about the Picard show not being able to reference the destruction of Romulus, going as far as to claim that the way the rights are divided between Paramount and CBS mean that the new movies can only reference stuff from past movies and shows can only reference stuff from past shows.

While there might be some legal nuances here, it's clearly not as clear cut. We've seen Section 31 in Kelvin movies despite previously being featured only on DS9 and ENT, not to mention Pike being someone who'd only been in TOS and never even mentioned in any of the movies before that. We now see Linus the Saurian on DIS, who's clearly an update on the Saurians from TMP. So it's pretty clear that CBS not being able to base anything even on past movies and Paramount on past shows is bunkum.

But the most important thing is that Discovery has already used something that had only been featured in the 2009 film: namely the Vulcan Learning Center with its skill domes, which were lifted directly from the Abrams movie in Burnham flashbacks.

Join the crew of 'The Gal'  in the year  2391. The USS Galileo-A is the latest Federation starship tasked to explore the secrets of the cosmos. A dedicated research vessel through and through, she measures only 180 meters in length and is dwarfed by larger ships of the line. She bears limited weapons, operational range, and crew amenities, yet is Starfleet's premier short-range survey vessel. She is not a ship of war nor a traditional multi-role heavy cruiser -- instead, her specialty is to perform in-depth exploration and analysis of nebulae, solar systems, and planetary bodies. She is an extension of the United Federation of Planets' core values which embody exploration, scientific knowledge, and peaceful first contact. Her small, standard operational crew is supplemented by civilian scientists and researchers who are the very best and brightest minds in the quadrant. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Galileo-A is affectionately known by her crew as 'The Gal' and is the first Nova-class Mark II starship to be commissioned by Starfleet. She replaces both the ageing Oberth-class and legacy Nova-class as the fleet's go-to instrument of mobile research and scientific investigation. What she lacks in sheer size and crew compliment is made up for by her versatility -- she is one of only two Federation starship classes capable of sustained atmospheric operations and planetary landing, and her small size and specialized Waverider-class atmospheric shuttle allow her to explore locations that larger starships are incapable of. Boasting the most advanced sensor arrays of any starship class, Galileo is a pure instrument of science that is dedicated to the discovery of new stellar phenomena, exoplanets, and life forms  Currently Recruiting:  Chief Operations Officer Chief Engineering Officer Asst Engineering Officer Asst Flight Control Officer

"What is the point of Star Trek V?So, I just watched Star Trek V for the first time. I have not seen any of the other TOS movies, but am a fan of ""bad movies"" and I kept reading how ""bad"" this one is. It seemed just okay to me, but I don't have the other movies to compare it to.

My question is...what is the message of Star Trek V? That God does not exist out there but inside of our hearts? I guess? Is it anti-religion, pro-religion? The idea of searching for God was a pretty interesting one, it could have made a really amazing movie if executed better and with more concrete metaphors and maybe more of a deep message...?

Anyway, yeah, the Uhura fan dance was pretty strange. I wonder whose idea that was...

Edit: Also, did the movie imply that this entity actually was the ""God"" of many different religions? Like, it was communicating to different civilizations throughout time because it was stuck in the center of the Galaxy and needed help? That's a pretty interesting science-fiction idea.",0

"Theory: The Dark Implication of Yesterdays EnterpriseThis is concerning Wesley Crusher's presence on the enterprise in this alternate timeline. s mentioned in the episode, because it is wartime, the enterprise is not occupied by children in this timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that his presence implies that the Federation has become so desperate for man power that they are fast-tracking entrance into Star Fleet and are essentially hiring child soldiers.

Picard: ""You did. And it won't have a better Captain.""

Riker: ""Me and Deanna were thinking about the good old days when we were all together on the...""

Picard: ""Great times! But I wanted to see you because there has been a personnel change you may not know about. We're assigning you a new first officer.""

Riker (confused): ""But Commander Willis has already been approved. We plan to pick him up at starbase....""

Picard: ""Yes, I'm sorry Riker. It came from above. They decided to move Willis to another ship and give you a new young officer who is rising in the ranks and has a very famous family history.""

Riker: ""OK, who is it?""

Picard: ""Do you know who Sarah Burnham is?""

Riker (confused): ""Uh, should I?""

Picard: ""Sarah Burnham?? The great, great, great grandchild of Micheal Burnham. Practically royalty Captain.""

Riker: ""Who?""

Picard: ""Ambassador Spock's sister? Did an 8 year tour of with the legendary U.S.S. Discovery? Helped ended the Klingon war...after she helped start it?""

Riker (more confused): ""Spock had a...sister? You knew?""

Picard: ""Of course! What you didn't? This is common knowledge. I learned of it through the mindmeld with Sarek back in season 3. She's human. The first human to attend the Vulcan Science Academy. Served under Captain Georgiou for 7 years before her being charge with mutiny. But got her rank back and eventually became Captain of the Discovery when there were no more TOS characters to show up. How can you not know this?""

Riker: ""I never been fond of 23rd century history I guess.""

Picard: ""Burnham was part of every important event during in that time. Do you remember when the first Khitomer Accords were signed with Kirk and his crew?""

Riker: ""Of course...was she there?""

Picard (nods head): ""Yep! There the whole time. After Kirk famously saved the President, Burnham can be seen in the crowd winking at her brother. You have to really slow the video down. It's a small frame, but she's there, trust me.""

Riker: ""Wow. That's impressive. What else was she involved in?""

Picard: ""She helped broker the peace between the Cardassia and Federation when she was Ambassador of the Kelpian homeworld where the talks happened.""

Riker: ""Kelpian?""

Picard: ""How did you manage to get out of Starfleet Academy? Yes, the Kelpian home world. Before it was destroyed several years later. She was also one of the first humans to live on Q'NoS to be closer to her lover Voq or Tyler or something. But became very close to the Chancellor at the time, L'rell. They were enemies during the war and there is a question if she ate Captain Georgiou or not but they became BFF later on. I just conveniently happen to have a picture of the three together. See?""

Riker (very confused): ""Those are **Klingons**?""

(Voice of Worf): ""*Those are Klingons...and it is a long story.*""

Riker frantically looks around the room: ""Wait, Sir, did you hear that?!? That sounded like....""

Picard: ""Anyway, Burnham has had a long canon rich history with her involvement with the Federation. In fact, I bet you can't name one thing in Starfleet history where she wasn't involved?""

"The Easy-Mac Solution to Star Trek Voyager's ""Long Trip""75,000 light years. That's quite a long road. However, they did have a simple solution available to them. First, let's observe 2 things. Time-travel has been a thing in Trek since TOS. Starfleet knows how to go back in time. Next, traveling at relativistic speeds (under the light barrier) is slow, but with time-dilation, the perception of the passage of time is that of a short trip *for you* (the one traveling near the speed of light. 

The EZ solution is that Voyager sling-shorts around a star, and goes back in time. Still 75,000 light-years away at this point, but with all the time in the universe to get there. Next step, accelerate to a significant fraction of the speed of light and let time-dilation kick in. *Your long-trip will now seem short.*

Do the math right and you arrive back in the Alpha quadrant a day or a week after you left. 

And let's not argue that Voyager can't crack the nut of NOT going faster-than-light in a ship that has done warp, transwarp, slipstream and spatial conduits. If they have the technology to do this, then they have the technology to accelerate the ship to an appreciable fraction of the speed of light without crossing the light barrier.

This struck me as pretty odd that the Federation would consider this normal.

"What do you think about Star Trek Discovery?—likely to be controversial

I’ve tried watching a few episodes, remaining as objective as possible, but this show seems to always leave me unsatisfied and ultimately puzzled as to what the writers were going for with a lot of the choices they made during production. It just doesn’t ‘feel’ like Star Trek to me.

I watched [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOSn0d56Eqw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=1m29s) scene the other day. At first, I was just confused, so I rewatched it; after the second time through, I was no less confused as to what exactly it was that I just saw, but this time i became suddenly appalled by the realization that this show carries the same name as previous installments of the franchise such as The Next Generation or even The Original Series. 

Now don’t get me wrong, I’m open to new ideas and even a new direction for the franchise entirely, but this just doesn’t seem right to me. I’d like some opposing opinions on the matter to consider. 

Here are some scenes from past series that are similar in nature to this one, yet, in my opinion, retain more of what I would consider the underlying themes of Star Trek as a whole: [1](https://youtu.be/JGn948_PXTU?t=1m23s), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVmldpYnFzw), or even [3](https://youtu.be/zlGRNRAL148?t=30s). 

For me, Star Trek Discovery is the confused grandchild of a tv show that was supposed to explore our inner selves more so than anything else. It is overly overt, distractingly glamorous, and too concerned with setting its self apart from the past that it often falls short in the areas that truly matter. 

Edit: 

1) As many of you have stated, and correctly so, Discovery is still in its infancy as a tv show. It would be wrong in saying that all the past shows did not have a rocky beginning as well, so it is best to remain open minded. However, I can say that I think out of all the shows, early season difficulties considered, Discovery still is the farthest from the rest both in terms of story telling and aesthetics. Ultimately, I will maintain a cautious yet optimistic outlook.

2) How the clips are related. 

I chose the three scenes from past Star Trek shows because, they are, at least in the most basic sense, similar in terms of subject and narrative, so there is a point of comparison to be made. Furthermore, I think there is a clear contrast between how the prior shows handled a scene like this compared to Discovery: This includes everything involved; plot, resolution, character interaction, visuals, effects, montage, camera use, etc. In full, the muse-en-scene  is what is in question.

"Lon Suder the ""sociopath""? (Voyager)I started watching Star Trek for the first time last year, and I'm up to Voyager S3:E1. On the subject of Lon Suder (the homicidal + creepy Betazoid ex-Marquis), and the holographic doctor referred to him as a ""sociopath"". 


This may be a minor detail, but it's actually bothering me. He's listed as a sociopath where ever he's mentioned, but... Wouldn't it be more accurate to refer to him as a psychopath? 


As far as I'm aware, he has never shown remorse for killing his fellow crewmate. He's merely trying to control his homicidal urges. Nothing about him indicates to me that he is a ""sociopath"", yet everything about him indicates to me that he is a ""psychopath"". 


What's the deal? Did Star Trek's writers just make a mistake, and everyone just ""went with it"", and it became canon? Or am I mistaken? Technically you could call him a sociopath, but it just seems much more accurate to use the term psychopath. The medical doctor **should know the difference**. 


At best, this might be explained away by saying ""in 2373, the term psychopath no longer exists"" or something.

"My biggest disappointment in Discovery first season vs all the other shows....it didn't create any new mythology!I was watching the DS9 first season finale yesterday, In the Hands of the Prophets (still one of the most underrated season finale's ever). I was watching the scene Keiko O'Brien and evil woman Vedek Winn debate over the wormhole aliens, orbs, etc as a religion vs science issue. 

It was a good reminder how much DS9 went out of its way to create it's mini-universe within a universe. None of those concepts were ever heard of in Star Trek until DS9 introduced them. And they really built up those ideas more in later seasons. And of course their mythology got even bigger once the Dominion was introduced and gave us not just a new villain but a entire story line built around them that went on for years.

Then I started thinking about Star Trek in general and just how big the overall mythology has become because every show has added to it in some way offering up new conflicts, aliens and concepts.

All except Discovery. :(

It's crazy but it's true. Just stay with me here, but every show from TOS to Enterprise has all introduced completely new ideas and concepts to the Trek universe. Just a tiny example of what I mean:

TOS- Well it's obvious being the first it set up everything in the universe: Starfleet, Klingons. Vulcans, Romulan war, 23rd century, etc, etc. And pretty much every major element from that show has been used on most shows in some fashion. 

TNG- It's first season set up the 24th century, but also gave us the Ferengi (yeah, I know), Q, the Borg (although didn't actually see them until second season), crazy new tech like holodecks, etc. It gave us old elements from TOS like the Klingons and star ships, but it prided itself on presenting new aliens and threats in its very first season.

DS9 has been mentioned.

Voyager- LOL that entire show created multiple new species and concepts being in the Delta quadrant of course. The Borg became it's main threat in later seasons but Voyager had tons of new species to play with and created a lot stories around them like the Kazon and the Ocampa being the first major arc.

Enterprise- While it's a prequel it actually went out of its way to create a lot of new mythology and background. Being in the only show in the 22nd century basically set up that era the way TNG did with the 24th. It laid the ground work of how Starfleet was perceived in the early days of space travel. But it still went farther by giving us the Temporal Cold War and the Suliban in the first season. It introduced a completely new idea in Star Trek and different species fighting over various timelines. And then later of course we got the Xindi arc which added to TCW but were a new villain completely.

And then we get to Discovery. And sadly they have added nothing to their own like the other shows started out. The only original concept the show has created is the spore drive and mycelial network. It's completely new but it's more of a plot device instead of a brand new story line. But outside of that, what was new?  They stuck to the Star Trek tradition of introducing a new alien we never seen before in Saru but that's really it. They have filled in concepts other shows already created like the Mirror Universe and the Klingon war. Next season we're getting Section 31 but that came from DS9. 

Is it a big deal, no, since it just hit me recently they didn't do anything new but it is odd DIS for all it's talk of being 'different' and 'modern' hasn't created any truly original ideas outside of one. Even when it came to new aliens, there has basically been two introduced so far: Saru and the Phavo aliens, which we saw in one episode. We see others walk around but we know zip about them. 

So maybe next season this show will create it's own mythology unique to Discovery but so far it's seriously lagging behind the others which is weird given how all the other shows went out their way to create new villains, histories and concepts. ",0

"Just got into Star Trek, Looking for help on shortened lists of must watch eps for TNG, DS9 and Voyager.Hi Guys,

First time over at this sub but the last few years i've been getting right back into Star Trek and was hoping for some guidance. I just just finished Discovery and its made me want to watch more Star Trek TV shows because i loved it, i've only ever watched a very small part of Voyager, the new Kelvin Timeline movies and maybe 3 - 3/12 of the original Movies. Im going to watch all the movies, but have decided to chuck on the first ep of TNG because i love Patrick Stewart and i enjoyed it a lot. I dont want to watch all 178 episodes but would be keen to see what people think is the best list of shortened must watch episodes. I've seen that there a lists like this for other shows so was keen to get everyone's thoughts as there are a million lists online but i thought here is a better place to start.

It would start with a starfleet cadet reciting the first line from the federation charter, then cut to an ordinary human on earth looking into the camera and reciting the next line.  Then continue that for each line with an ordinary person from a different federation species - Vulcan, Andorian, Tellerite, Betazoid etc.  Just the preamble, though, not all the rules and bylaws that would take forever.  Just establishing the basic principles of the federation through people from all walks of life right from the get go.  It sounds very...Picard.

"Having a hard time getting through VoyagerI’ve watched TOS, TNG, and DS9. DS9 is my favorite but I love them all for different reasons. With caution and trepidation I decided to give Voyager a shot. The series opening was great with a wonderful premise and then it flatlines. 

I’m on episode 5 and they decided to do jack shit with that incredible premise and decided to throw in TOS/TNG like Eps with a limited crew with limited resources. I’m having a hard time giving a shit. It’s a rehash of old Trek content in a show with a very good premise. At this point it has dropped every single plot line established from the original pilot, such as the tension between the federation working with the Macquis, or being 70 years away from home. They’re treating it like a space vacation. Every episode I watch I’m like,”I wish I were watching BSG instead.”

I want to like it because it’s Star Trek and I’m so conflicted that I don’t. I never had a problem watching “bad” Trek before. People said to skip TNG seasons 1 and 2 and I enjoyed s1 despite the flaws and loved s2 despite what people say.

The Next Generation introduced the first Klingon and (half) Betazoid main cast member (and android if you count them as species)!

"How do I watch Star Trek?I want to like Star Trek.  I really do.  I just... can't.

To put this into some context, the very first science fiction show I ever watched was West World.  That, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.  I watched reruns of TOS but had to leave the room when the news came on because the Vietnam War was a thing on the news and my parents were being parents.  I loved Space: 1999 even though I questioned how the moon could travel so far through space so quickly (my mom said, ""Don't worry about it.  It's just a TV show. They do dumb stuff like that."" or words to that effect). Later I watched Dr. Who (Tom Baker is my Doctor, the others are pale imitations).  I read Heinlein and Asimov and Bova and Pournelle and Niven. I knew what Science Fiction was.

And Star Trek just wasn't science fiction.  Sure, it was futuristic, sort of.  It had gee whiz bang effects.  But it wasn't *science* fiction. I have tried watching all the newer Star Trek fare but it just doesn't sit right with me.  All too often I pop on an episode, excited for the spectacle, hoping for some wonderful story to unfold, and then... nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

On another subreddit people were talking about plot holes and whatnot, and something someone said got me to thinking. They were hand waving away my concerns about stories which broke the way real world technology worked through what was obviously the sheer thundering stupidity of the writers, then hinging the entire plot around that point.  They told me I simply wasn't watching it correctly.  Apparently it is necessary to 'forget' things you know to enjoy shows these days.  (re-reading that last sentence, it seems to come off more harshly than intended.  Or maybe it's an understatement...)

Anyway, if you're still reading at this point, I thank you and I have a question for you.  How am I supposed to watch Star Trek?  What is it that you get out of it?  What does it show you and what do you see and feel when you watch it? I'm genuinely curious.  I want to like Star Trek, but I just don't know how.

"TOS ""Space Seed"" Kirk treated Khan as well as possibleI saw ST II: Wrath of Khan long before watching TOS ""Space Seed"", Khan's origin episode.

I was fairly shocked at the actual ending of that initial conflict, how patient and forgiving Kirk was with Khan during his trial and before! Spock was much more vocally combative throughout the episode, although it's revealed to be somewhat at the behest of Kirk.

And in the end, Kirk lets Khan keep his people, his new hostage/lover, and his dignity (all at a loss to Starfleet in retrospect). Based off WoK, I had thought Kirk was MUCH harsher in this scenario.

So it can be said the Kirk/Khan conflict is mostly one-sided, ""white whale-ish"" to an insane degree, and stems from Khan's necessity  for a nemesis who can match his wits.  

Kirk's only mistake in creating his ""arch-nemesis"" was presenting himself intelligently and respectfully.",0

The dialog options have me the choice to resist. So I did. And I kept doing it, purposely sabotaging the implants. As time wore on, my sabotages became more violent and brutal. And eventually it dawned on me. In resisting, I'm causing greater harm to, and perhaps killing others. If I continued to resist, I'd be causing more suffering.

So I conceded. I stopped harming them.and followed orders. They won and beat me. They had control. Well, at least until my friends got me out. Hey, you need agency in a game, after all.

Overall this series has just been incredible. Amazing characters and great long running stories. I think I was most impressed by the ""villains"" of the show which I only state that way because this is absolutely a show about change. Watching someone like Damar and the way he goes from background extra, to hated POS, to savior is just amazing. And of course Kai Winn is just one of the best written characters ever. And the crew is great to, especially Jadzia who is everything I aspire to be. Also Bashir and O'Brien forever. Like any Star Trek show it wasn't perfect, but I just loved it all so much along the way!

"What era would you consider Star Trek's 'Golden Age'?Just curious out there but what do people consider when Star Trek was at it's peak? I don't mean just ratings and popularity (although that can certainly be included of course) but when you felt Trek was at it's best? Or most exciting?

And I don't mean just one show but the franchise in general? And maybe a span of 10 years, give or take a few. You can start from the first year when TOS started all the way up until now (since the Kelvin films have been around 9 years now and Discovery has started). 

For me personally, I think it's 1990 to 2000. That was a rich history of Trek for a number of reasons:

A. This was when TNG came into it's element, specifically in 1990 because that was around it's third season and when the show took off both creatively and popularity. 

B. While TUC wasn't the best TOS film, it was damn near close and was a great way to end those adventures. And 1991 was the 25th anniversary of the franchise marking a pivotal moment.

C. DS9 premiered in 1993 and turned into one of the best shows IMO. And it finished in the year 2000. It also showed that Star Trek could just do more than fly in star ships and we started to see cracks in Federation virtue.  Sadly haven't gotten a show like it since.

D. While not super successful TNG launched into films and did give us one of the biggest events in Trek history, having Kirk and Picard in the same film in Generations. For people who were around back then this did feel monumental in so many ways. A Star Trek film made the cover of Time Magazine. That said a lot. First Contact is still one of the best Trek films and was a great tie in to the 30th anniversary putting the Borg on the big screen. Sadly I have not been as excited about a Trek film since. 

E. Voyager premiering in 1995. Yes the show isn't as great as the others but it's still a great show. And Voyager actually created a few milestones on its own. It was the first Star Trek show since TOS to premiere on a network, 29 years later. It's pilot, Caretaker, to this day is the most watched Trek pilot with around 22 million viewers. And that was a relief because it was also the most costliest Trek pilot lol. One of the costliest period at $23 million. In 1995 at that. To this day only two other pilots cost more: Game of Thrones and Westworld. And yes our first woman Captain! 

E. And this probably was when Trek was at it's most popular in regards to merchandise and awareness. I remember walking into a Toys R Us back in 97 and there was an shelf devoted to Star Trek. Models, toys, games, etc. This was when new characters would show up after an episode aired and thrown up on shelves. You could buy Star Trek everything from clocks to bed sheets. And I was personally buying this stuff. I had my own Star Trek shelf of toys, episodes and movies, soundtracks, books, trading cards and even the Star Trek communicator magazine. Yes HUGE nerd lol! 

For me, this was definitely when I think Trek was at it's golden age. There was just always something going on. Trek felt mainstream in the sense you turn on a TV it was on somewhere. Because so many new shows were coming out new fans were always finding it. They still find it like here but at that time it was already so big that it I knew someone who was watching some of it if not all. 

But like I said, this is just my opinion. Some people it may be when TOS started and when fandom was just getting going through the first TOS film. Others my think it was when TWOK hit theaters and had a good run through TUC. Some may even think the first Kelvin film gave us a new and different era from all of those and made Trek mainstream it never was before.

"Communicator Panel Confusion (ENT)Whenever someone is paged, usually the captain, that person has to stop what they are doing, head over to the wall and press a button to respond. This takes some time, usually at least a few seconds. However, when the captain pages someone they respond instantly, every time. Are the off-screen crew members just standing next to the comm panels waiting on the captain to page them?

Furthermore, it seems as though you have to be next to the comm panel to communicate through it, but in engineering, Trip can talk to, and hear from, the comm regardless of his location in the room. 

Do they have an intercom in engineering? Do certain rooms, like engineering, medical and the bridge have intercom systems? If this is the case how do they know when someone is sending an outgoing message and when they are just talking to someone in the room? On the bridge, Hoshi controls this. Is there a communications officer in all the rooms with intercoms?",0

"Rewatching Wrath of Khan - one thing still bothers me...Why did Sulu reverse away from the Reliant and effectively do a J-turn? He then plots a course away from the Reliant at a tangent.

Surely it would have made more sense to go immediately to full impulse and navigate away from the Reliant, in the opposite direction of the way Reliant was drifting.

Using both full impulse and the Reliant's drift to put the maximum amount of distant between the two ships, before the explosion, would have made more sense.

Yes, I'm aware that ultimately it probably wouldn't have made much of difference if they had still been in the blast area when the torpedo detonated, but it still seems a strange choice nonetheless.",0
"___ episodes - Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 1I've decided to start my newbie kind of overview. I will write one at the end of every season I watch.

So first off, we start off with:

Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 1 -  \_\_\_  episodes

**Best 5 Episodes - Best to Worst**

1. Datalore
2. Conspiracy
3. 11001001
4. Arsenal of Freedom
5. The Neutral Zone

Explanation: Datalore was amazing to me, honestly, I loved all of it, especially that last transporter fight with Wesley, Lore, and Data. Conspiracy was very memorable and very dark and engaging. 11001001 was just overall a good episode, with cool aliens, and a believable plot. Arsenal of Freedom was also a good episode, with character development for Geordi, and more on Crusher and Picard. The Neutral Zone was anti climatic, but the beginning was amazing. The music in the meeting room close to the beginning was perfect. And it also hinted on the Borg, as well.

Honorable Mentions:

Home Soil: Loved this fun detective episode

Heart of Glory: Gave us background on Worf and Klingons.

The Battle: Also a great episode, but it always gives me a headache, not because it is bad, but because Picard had headaches.

**Worst 5 Episodes - Worst to Best**

1. Code of Honor
2. The Naked Now
3. Angel One
4. Justice
5. When the Bough Breaks

Explanation: Code of Honor was not just boring, but also a plain racist story, The Naked Now was weird and the plot wasn't too intriguing, it was a rehash of the Naked Time. Angel One was also sexist, in a way, with the whole men-women thing flipped around, and the B-plot, the cold, was kind of... silly, Justice was hard to believe, and very corny and silly, what with Wesley falling into flowers... And When the Bough Breaks was full of plotholes, like why do they just pick so little children, wouldn't they have picked more?  Sorry if that wasn't a lot, but there isn't really that much to say.

​

**Bonuses:**

​

Most overrated = The Big Goodbye

Not saying it is bad, but some parts of it was sort of boring and I thought it wasn't as good as a lot of other episodes, still in the higher range for Season 1, but not the best.

Also: Hide and Q

Good episode, but still not really **that** good.

Also: Where No One Has Gone Before

I didn't really find it to be all that good, unfortunately. Some parts of it were boring.

​

Most memorable = Conspiracy

What with exploding heads and eating parasites, of course this is very memorable!

​

**Conclusion:**

Well, I guess that's all! Remember, this is my opinion and is not a general guide or anything, I recommend watching all the episodes, like for me, Justice and When the Bough Breaks weren't half as bad as I thought they would be.

I'm marking as spoiler because I don't know if this counts or not.

Also, I'm a noob Trekkie, so don't be too hard on me. Hope you all Live Long and Prosper!

​

Edit: Revised the bad episodes explanation.

I guess it's only from seeing them in the movies growing up and hearing about them that I had kinda expected the Borg to be this real big deal the first time they were shown on screen. But instead it was just that cosmic jackass being a dick.


In other watching Star Trek TNG news, a few episodes ago was the first episode I actually remember watching as a child, took a season and a half, but that one where commander Riker goes over to a Klingon vessel to be their second in command, and some bacteria eats away at the Enterprise and Klingon vessel.

"Star Trek TV Themes RankedI had my M-5 multitronic unit, which I picked up for a song on eBay some years ago, analyze and rank the six Star Trek TV series theme songs in order of best to worst. As always, the M-5's results are [foolproof and incapable of error](https://youtu.be/AD8YvY7PqYY?t=53s).

1. [**Star Trek: Voyager**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtVXAugaSm0)**.** Dennis McCarthy's haunting theme never fails to send a shiver up my spine. In less than two minutes McCarthy manages to convey both the existential sadness and the shining optimism that drives the good ship *Voyager*, trapped 75 years away from everything any of its crew have ever loved in this life, to find a way to cheat physics and get themselves the hell home.
2. [**Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc_0ii3SLp0)**.** This was going to be my number one entry until I remembered that Voyager was a thing. The amazing Dennis McCarthy once again comes through with a theme that's perfect for a lonely space station located on--deal with it, Kira--the galactic frontier. McCarthy is at his best when he gets to work with an Aaron Copland-esque wonder at the unknown, and he delivers here in spades.
3. [**Star Trek**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdjL8WXjlGI)**.** This is where it all began, and it pains me to rank it third out of six. Alexander Courage's genuinely timeless fourteen-note intro has become one of the most recognizable musical motifs of the twentieth century, a feat that becomes more jaw-droppingly amazing the more one thinks about it, and is directly quoted in the themes of two of its successor series. Alas, its greatness is marred by the somewhat dated main theme that follows, which in TOS's second and third seasons features vocalising that... well, it's a product of its time, let's leave it at that.
4. [**Star Trek: Discovery**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcTvrxwP6Is)**.** The newcomer comes through with a surprisingly strong entry from composer Jeff Russo. Let's be honest here: The Discovery theme is a mess, but it's a glorious mess. Russo starts by acknowledging just two notes of Alexander Courage's iconic, half-century-old TOS theme, then launches into an entirely new composition that is nevertheless informed by at least three Berman-era themes, only to return a minute later to Courage's timeless signature. I nearly cried the first time I heard it. No lie.
5. [**Star Trek: The Next Generation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsxgcLf0TSY)**.** The good news is that it starts with Alexander Courage's classic fanfare. The bad news is that it's followed up by Jerry Goldsmith's recycled theme for TMP, which was showing its age even in 1987. To 2018 ears,  it comes across as bombastic nonsense to the point of self-parody. Look, I know that for many of you TNG was your first exposure to Trek and this theme will always hold a place in your heart, but the sooner you come to terms with the fact that the theme is complete crap, the better. Rarely have I been more grateful for Netflix's ""Skip Opening Credits"" option.
6. **Star Trek: Enterprise**, which I refuse to link for self-respect reasons. The less said about this perfunctory MOR offering from schlockmeister Diane Warren, the better. True confession time: I genuinely have only heard this theme song in its entirety approximately twice, because I owned a TiVo DVR back in 2001, and I only ever needed to hear this fragrant piece of shit once or twice before it became abundantly clear that I never, ever needed to hear it again. So fuck you, Diane Warren, I don't give a shit how goddamn long of a road it's fucking been, and I never will. I--Jesus, I'm legitimately getting angry about this, and it's been seventeen years. In conclusion, fuck you Diane Warren.

"USS Paladin Season 2 Ending!Hello again! 
I am King_JoLo, and I have been running a Star Trek Text-based Roleplay for Star Trek for quite a while now and we are interested in expanding our group with more Trekkies! 

What is it?
USS Paladin is an RP server using Discord, simulating the entire deck plan of the USS Paladin, a souvereign class starship. We have 24/7 RP but the main focus lies on events, which are at least once a week with smaller ones in between. 

How does it work?
As with all RP's, you can create a character with backstory, species, etc. Once you have your character, that's it! You can begin RP at any time once your character is accepted. You will have your own quarters as well (May have a roommate). 
Besides that we use Discord's functions to create a rank and department (science, tactical, medical, operation and engineering) system and to simulate the many rooms present on a large starship. 
Additionally, we work with ""episodes and seasons"". Similar to actual Star Trek show. (For reference, we are currently in season 2 episode 18 as of writing this).

What do I need to join?
You only need three things:
1. Proper english. It doesn't have to be perfect (I'm not natively english speaking myself either), but if you can understand and replicate what's said in Star Trek shows you're good!
2. Will to RP.
3. Maturity. The server is considered 18+ (due to some romance, but you will find it limited in the ERP sense, only in quarters).

If you feel interested feel free to check out the server. If you don't rp (and of course don't cause trouble) you are always welcome to just hang out and check out our top-kek memes/game nights!

If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this post, or (assuming you joined the server, which will explain many potential questions with a more detailed explanation and ruleset) you can PM me, or ask anyone your question in the general OOC channel.

"Captain's Quarters - Help with researchHi everyone, 

I'm doing research for a project that requires me to find good quality images of all the captain's quarters in each series of Star Trek. For some I've done alright (TOS, TNG, even DISCO, even though I think Lorca's quarters only appeared once). However, I've exhausted what I've been able to find online, so I need to go through a few episodes on Netflix and take screenshots. But yeah, there's hundreds of episodes out there.

So, if anyone wants to help, it would save me a ton of time if you can think of any episodes of DS9, Voyager and Enterprise that have prominent scenes in the captain's quarters.

Thank you!",0
"TNG S2E22 ""Shades of Gray"" Do I need to watch this epside?This seems like one of those flashback-style episodes I've seen in other shows too, so I'm planning on skipping it for now. If anyone knows if it is more than a filler ep, I'll go back and watch it later. Also, are there any other genuinely filler episodes in the other seasons of TNG that you would recommend skipping?

​

I've found some other lists online; however, they seem to recommend skipping ones that they consider unimportant but may still be a good watch. If the episode is shitty, I'd still like to judge that for myself. However, if it's just flashbacks, I'll skip. Thanks.

"One of the main motifs in Star Trek is the idea that Human society has reached a point where money has become obsolete. But has it ever been explained how humanity deals with the distribution of resources that are inherently scarce, such as land?For the sake of discussion, let's assume we are talking about Federation citizens on Earth, who want to remain on Earth and not transition to another Federation world/colony for whatever reason. 

How are the waterfront properties (and other highly desired properties) distributed, and what if someone decides that they want to stop living in a city and move to a farm somewhere or visa versa? 

Our current society deals with these problems by allowing natural market forces to occur and assign a monetary value to land, but how would the Federation settle these issues in a world where money no longer exists?",0

"Something I Wish They'd Done With QI've been re-watching TNG and, like many other fans, I get super excited for the episodes with Q. It always cracks me up that he chooses to dress in a Starfleet uniform, but I think they missed a huge opportunity here with the number of pips he wears. Like Picard (and all other captains), he wears 4 pips. But, I've always thought it would have been funnier if he wore 5, instead. Just to really show Picard, Sisko, Janeway, etc. that he is truly above them (and to mess with them even more). I think this would have been a funny, subtle little thing they could've done with Q.

Anyway, just a random thought and I'm sure many have already said this before me. I just thought I'd share.  ",0
"Why TNG 5-25 “The Inner Light” is OverratedBefore you even start. I’ve seen many a Star Trek series, TNG is my favorite, and one of my favorite shows period. Now I haven’t seen EVERY episode in quite some time so while binge viewing on YouTube I came to this, one of the more ballyhooed episodes. Now for those of you unaware, “The Inner Light” concerns Picard being knocked unconscious by a probe and living for some 40 years as a man in a doomed civilization. At first he’s focused on reaching the Enterprise, and gradually he fits in and lives a full life among them complete with family. By the end Picard returns to consciousness with the newfound knowledge of these long dead people. Firstly, from a practical perspective this is a Picard episode. That means if you watch the show because you enjoy ANY other character, you’re SOL. From a plot perspective, you’re telling me this civilization has a probe capable of this, yet spend the entire episode talking about their primitive tech and inability to send people into space?! What’s more, they apparently agreed this torture is the best method for passing on their culture. Lastly, the character of Picard falls victim to Stockholm syndrome. He has no ill-will toward his captors nor their grand duping. Totally out of character. It seems the writers were preoccupied with the concept of Picard growing old in an alternative life, letting the majority of the cast take a vacation, and not in making a complete, sensible episode.

"Actors Matterhttps://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456518/star-trek-4-without-chris-pine-heres-what-one-producer-says

According to some guy named Adi Shankar, producer, ""actors don't matter, stories do."" Yes, stories are important, but there's no need to trade one for the other if you can trade one actor for another (Hemsworth for Pine). If it's a matter of Pine's contract being up, that's just a standard problem to be solved and maybe it's time for an entire recast or a movie without Kirk at all.

I maybe it's old(er) age and franchise fatigue on my part, but seeing multiple actors play certain roles within a ten year span, or on TV shows versus movies (DC universe) just doesn't seem right and dilutes the general image of characters. Obviously characters being played by multiple actors is an accepted part of fictional media, but I think it should be avoided where possible.

There's a reason so many people want to see Stewart back as Picard. Even if Pine can't compare the the Shakepearean skill of Stewart, keeping the cast together for a couple movies would cement him more solidly as Kirk. Let him actually spend some time contemplating being his character instead of jumping and running around all movie and it might turn out he can act.",0
Has Star Trek ever addressed the reasoning behind human-like species across the vastness of space?It's clear that several species are human-like for production's sake.

There's a scene in ""The Man Trap"" where Kirk is down on a planet, trying to raise the Enterprise on his communicator to warn them about an alien that's loose on board. At around the 38:36 mark, Netflix reckoning, he pulls out the communicator and says, ""Trek to Enterprise"", to which Sulu responds ""Bridge to Captain"". What's up with that ""Trek to Enterprise"" line? Did the things they called ""away missions"" on TNG used to be called ""treks"", or did he (understandably) flub the line ""Kirk to Enterprise"" and no one caught it? Or is it something else I'm not thinking of? I searched online and couldn't find anything specifically explaining this, and not even Memory Alpha mentions it as far as I can tell.",0

They shit on Worf for having a level head and (*gasp*) thinking things through during their almost-civil-war. And while the Bat'leth looks kinda cool, a space-faring society shouldn't advocate melee weapons training when a phaser would ice them in half a second. 

I don't remember hearing the part of their history where they value scientific research and reward Klingons who would rather study than fight. So...how did these cavemen make a freaking wrap drive?

I've seen the films, played the video game, and read all of IDW's 'Star Trek: Ongoing' and 'Star Trek: Boldly Go' and I love it so much. It also reinforces my feeling that Star Trek works best as a series and films do it a bit of a disservice. 

For personal reasons, I relate so much with Jim Kirk in the Kelvin Timeline, and I love seeing how he grows and matures over the course of the films and comics.

The last issue of 'Star Trek: Boldly Go' was so great and makes the news of Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth stepping away from Kelvin Timeline Star Trek 4 all the more heartbreaking.

"Replicated food cultivation possible?I am rewatching voyager and in s2e21 “deadlock” there is a conversation about Neelix using fresh food over the synthetic “replicator food” but the yields from the hydroponics bay had been low. This got me thinking, mostly around voyager needing a hydroponics bay to make food so replicator energy wasn’t used as often. what if seeds were made using the replicator systems, could they have been used to grow “earth food”. 

Perhaps possibly getting the seeds to geminate through splicing with alien plants/vegetables. We know it’s possible as Tuvox has shown in an earlier episode how he created a new type of orchard by taking cuttings from (I think it was an earth orchard) and attaching the to a Vulcan orchard; creating an entirely new plant.  

 Possible reasons to do this (in voyagers case)? Earth food dishes being more earth like (neelix tries bless him) ability to cultivate/farm more food, saves the need to trade for food/search for food. 

I know replicators can my crest “life” so not sure how this could work. 

Further to this, more of an after thought, what about using transporters to replicate living things. We know patten buffers are stored in the transporters so when someone/something is transported, de materialised  and then reintegrated it could be possible to create infinite copies. Again this is possible due to the existence of two William Rikers. Now I am not saying they could make more people but again along the terms of plants/food a transporter/replicator mash up? It could have also have solved limited resources on voyager. Sorry to keep using voyager as an example it’s what I am currently rewatching.) 

Just some random thoughts on the subject. ",0

I thought I’d share this here. I was looking for a wallpaper for my phone that included my favourite Picard quote, but I couldn’t find the perfect design, so I opened up photoshop and made this: https://imgur.com/a/7wsBbDg

"411: Star Trek Fandom Books?Hello,

Does anyone have recommendations for good books chronicling the early days of Star Trek fandom?  I'm particularly interested in the formation of snail mail clubs with newsletters and the early days of Star Trek conventions.  Mostly the 1970s to the 1980s, when the only Star Trek was TOS.

I've read ""Star Trek Lives"" and that's very good, but I'm looking for more to read.

"Looking for Voyager episode where Janeway mentions sleep with NeelixThis is rather absurd and I don't know how else to say it, but:


there's a Voyager episode where Janeway and Neelix are in a shuttlecraft and Neelix keeps making noise on the bridge, which wakes up Janeway, who grumpily says she only really needs (small amount) of hours of sleep anyway before rolling her eyes.
I think it's the same episode where Janeway is replaced by an imposter Janeway (not the bad actor imposter episode?)

The series would explore post-scarcity human culture in contrast to the fiercely capitalist society of the Ferengi. Our human protaganist, the audience surrogate, finds himself at odds with the greed, inequality and exploitation present (and, at times, rampant) in Ferengi culture. He struggles with Ferengi trying to take advantage of him, as well as barriers to doing his work. He also finds common grounds with the Ferengi and learns more about himself, humanity, and human potential that continues to be realized. What do you think of this concept?",0

"Audiobook roadtrip reviewI recently had two very long drives (14+ hours each).  To maintain my sanity, and provide some entertainment, I picked up a bunch of Star Trek audiobooks.  For the super short summary jump to the end.

**Star Trek: The Next Generation**  
**The Genesis Wave Series**

Read by Tim Russ, this was a very entertaining series.  My TV guide summary would be: someone, somewhere, has revived the Genesis Project in a horrible new way and the crew of the Enterprise must save the galaxy.

It felt like a pretty solid multi-episode arc that you would never see on TNG when it originally aired.  I think it just requires too much ""continuity"" between franchises (it uses elements from TOS, TNG, and DS9) to work in TNG's television paradigm back in the day.  It had a great Star Trek feel, but with a greater freedom than the TV format allows.

Do you have to read/listen to all four books to get closure?  No.  Sort of.  To be fair, my recollection is a bit fuzzy due to the mindlessness of driving for 14 hours, but here's what I remember.

Book One sets up the Genesis Wave and the horrors it unleashes.  Can the Enterprise find the source?

Book Two has the Enterprise investigating the source and trying to find a way to stop it.

Book Three apparently was written later (I just learned that now!) which would explain why it felt like it could stand alone.  Basically the technology from Books One and Two has fallen into the hands of a religious zealot and new troubles arise.

Book Four is the book of Worf.  Ok that's an exaggeration.  But, I kept wondering where he was for Books 1-3, and this book answers that question.  It basically is a standalone episode focusing on one planet affected by the Genesis Wave.

Tim Russ does a great job narrating.  He doesn't do ""voices"" necessarily, but the way he voices the different characters is fantastic.  He includes speech mannerisms like pacing, emphasis, etc. Along with the author's dialogue for the characters, you can get a pretty good sense of who's talking to whom.

I did feel like the series was a bit ""darker"" than TNG I'm used to.  For example: the very premise of the book requires the destruction of several planets with large populations.  I know we've seen destruction before (Borg, the Nexus) but this felt darker.

I'd recommend books 1 and 2 if you only have a 7-hour drive.  If you've got closer to 10 hours, add book 4.  Only if you're on a really long drive, or really want a bunch of audiobooks, would I recommend book 3.

[My main complaint about Book 3 is spoiler-y:](#s ""There were a bunch of passages written where I was like 'Why is the author spending so much time describing how attractive a female alien is?' Well it turns out it's because she was manipulating Picard's mind to make him fall so desperately in love with him that he'd undo his whole career and life for her.  So it was decent writing, but I just felt like it was a really cheesy plot device.  I dunno... it just didn't work for me"")

**Star Trek: Deep Space Nine**
**Legends of the Ferengi**

Clearly a money-making tie-in of a book.  I still enjoyed it. 
 ~~Armin Shimerman~~ Quark narrates and basically it's a bunch of short stories to illustrate various Ferengi Rules of Acquisition.

Remember the episode of DS9 where they had that educational program for children and Quark was teaching them math?  It basically felt like that.  It was an entertaining way to pass an hour.

Major caveat: the audio quality on this sounds like it was pulled from a cassette tape found at a used book store.  Ok, I exaggerate slightly, but be ready to adjust your EQ and deal with 90s audio.

**Star Trek**
**Spock vs. Q: The Sequel**

I *loved* the first Spock vs Q but didn't know there was a sequel until last week.  While not as good as the first, this one still does a great job.  John De Lancie and Leonard Nimoy both sound like they had a lot of fun making this.  There's a lot of role-reversal humor in this one and while it's enjoyable, there are definitely some jokes that don't land as well.

**Star Trek**
**The Eugenics Wars: Book Two**

By mistake I picked up book two instead of book one.  But I figured it shouldn't be too hard to catch up.  After all, even the Genesis Wave books do a good job of reminding you what happened in the last book.

I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as the others.  The main thing it had going for it was Rene Auberjonois' narration.  While some of his accents aren't perfect, I felt he captured the characters' personalities well in his portrayals.  It was easy for me to know who was speaking at any time, even when I was tuned out to focus on driving.

The plot, as far as I can gather, is that Khan and his genetically-enhanced kin escaped from the facility creating them and have run amok.  Gary Seven is on the case, but apart from him barely anyone knows that the Eugenics War is even happening.  The plot spent more time on the infighting among the genetically-enhanced than any threat from them against ""normal"" humans.  When TOS or TNG refer to the Eugenics Wars they talk as if everyone knows about the horrors that took place.  But this book makes it seem like only a small number of people ever knew what was happening, and the horrors don't actually seem that bad.

I got the feeling that the Eugenics Wars were discussed in the same discussions of other atrocities of the 1980s and 1990s, and that they were all linked in the cultural memory of the Federation.  While this book does discuss the participation of the genetically-enhanced in conflicts in Bosnia, Rwanda, and American extremists, because it's all so cloak-and-dagger hidden from the rest of the world made it lose a lot of impact for me.

I think this series is probably worth skipping.

**In brief**

* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Books 1 and 2.  Recommended!  Enjoyable.  Good TNG.
* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Book 3.  Weakest of the four books.  Skippable.
* Star Trek: The Next Generation.  The Genesis Wave: Book 4.  Enjoyable.  Worf gets a turn.
* Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Legends of the Ferengi.  Entertaining fluff.  If you don't like Quark or the Ferengi, you won't like this.
* Star Trek: Spock vs Q: The Sequel.  Highly recommended, but not as amazing as the original.
* Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: Book Two.  Skip it.  Plot feels more like a bad Doctor Who episode ",0

"Thinking about Star Trek's future tech, then vs now.I always find it fascinating thinking about the future technology concepts star trek's writers thought up, and how we look at them at the time of conception vs the our modern day perception.

Take for instance the data padd, basically just the digital equivalent of paper. Instead of making a multi page report/document, or a book, you have this slim piece of plastic. It seems way more efficient, and overall has a nice sci fi look.

Then you see scenes like Jake Sisko is cleaning up his room and stuggling to carry a dozen of these little things, probably from his schoolwork assignments and whatnot. And in our modern day age of smartphones, you can't help but think ""why do people have multiples of these, wouldn't you just need one for all your stuff?"".

Not saying it like its a flaw on the writers, it's just something funny I've noticed as time goes on. Alternatively we must have absolutely nailed [Pour spouts](http://www.hawaiian-shaved-ice-syrup.com/assets/images/pour_spout.jpg) cause they're still using those same things 300 years later.",0

"Any other LGBT Trekkies? What are your favorite and least favorite things about the Star Trek Franchise as an LGBT?I’m a 26 year old gay man. I was always extremely disappointed that Star Trek seemed to tackle every social issue except homosexuality/transgender directly.

[EDIT] I forgot to add that Dax also has a Lesbian affair with her wife from a previous lifetime. 
I’m thrilled that Discovery finally has a gay character but it’s too little too late. 
As a gay man my favorite character and the character who I think most represented LGBT culture is Lwaxana Troi, she is fabulous, fashionable, outrageous, sassy and always wearing the latest styles, in some ways she reminds me of a Drag Queen and I plan to attend my next Trek Con as Lwaxana in Drag! Overall Star Trek is amazing and tackled many social issues but it’s sad that we had to wait til 2017 to see a gay character. Voyager ran into the 2000s when homosexuality was allowed on TV.

It's a wonderful episode about Sisko's mentor, Admiral Layton, taking advantage of the fear of a Dominion Invasion and faking one so he can declare martial law over Earth and, essentially, form a military dictatorship. His reasoning (and I believe he is sincere, if a bit deluded) is that is The Federation waits until they actually NEED StarFleet to control Earth it will be too late. Being the Supreme Commander over Earth is also appealing, I'm sure.

Of course, Sisko and Odo uncover the plot and end it before Layton can take over, and they are right to do so.

I watched Dear Doctor before bed the other night which was almost a mistake because I stayed up at least an hour thinking about it. There’s no way Archer made the right decision, but I still love who thoughtful yet fun this series has been. The cast is great too. The actor who plays Trip does an amazing job.",0

"I kind of miss Kes and The Year in Hell ArcI'm currently watching Voyager for the first time along with r/StarTrekViewingParty.  I'm a bit ahead, so I decided to post this here. I'd encourage no spoilers, but if it's necessary PLEASE use the spoiler tag.

&amp;#x200B;

Before i start, I just want to say Kes was absolutely one of my favorite characters. I knew she left the show at some point, and at first, it didn't bother me. This all changed once I started season 3 and I was blown away. Kes became an amazing character. I think she should've been left on an M class planet and remained in touch with Tuvok. Once she regained control of her powers, she could've come back. I know it wouldn't 100% work, but it would've been better in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just started the Year in Hell two parter, and it feels wrong without Kes. Ignoring the whole Jennifer Lein got fired or quit controversy, I understand why Kes isn't there (to some extent). Kes and Tom got married and Janeway and B'Elanna die in the alternate version. If Kes survived, there's a chance those same events would've occurred, but that does not make it absolute.

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys haven't heard, the original idea was for the Year in Hell to be an arc spanning a few episodes (like the Dominion War in the last season of DS9). Since Lein decided not to renew her contract, the idea was scrapped. Personally, I think they should have gone with the arc idea. It would've made the danger more real (if that makes sense). I think part of why they didn't was because Berman was one of the producers, and he hated the Dominion War arc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like to know your opinion on it. Should Kes have stayed, and should The Year in Hell have been an arc instead of a two parter?",0

"Instead of Discovery, they should've made a Star Trek show that focused on Klingons.Of course, I wouldn't want the Klingon's to look like they do in Star Trek Discovery. I'd prefer they look like they did in DS9 &amp; TNG. I'd also prefer this show look similar to the style of TNG &amp; DS9.

They could delve deep into Klingon culture, the wars they went through, their traditions, rituals, strengths, weaknesses and all the bad ass things Klingons do.  Then of course, add tons of hot Klingon women with the cleavage and everything.  Battles, rough sex, war, that'd be awesome. Then we'd get to bear witness to the Klingon perspective when they deal with the federation and other cultures.  That'd be so interesting.

When Klingons receive a distress call from a planet from another race/culture that's in need, what would Klingons do?  Do they ever help those in need? If so, how? Do they coddle them or challenge them to make them stronger?

But noooo, instead we get Star Trek Discovery which is terrible. *sigh*",0
"An easy way to fix the controversy around Discovery (Many spoilers if you have not seen Discovery).Love it or loathe it, Discovery is at least here for a 2nd series. 

Personally, I like the show but it took a 2nd binge watch on Netflix to get there. However, it has many many issues that just do not fit with Trek cannon.  Now....I could nit pick each and every issue but I'm just going to focus on the one major issue in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Warning: Spoilers ahead! 

&amp;#x200B;

The Spore drive! 

&amp;#x200B;

Now...I like the idea of the Spore drive. It's interesting, opens up numerous possibilities.....but so help me it spits in the face of all other Trek.  I'm just going to put this in perspective for a moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Federation (or at least Stamets) makes an engine that allows Discovery to go anywhere in the universe in the blink of an eye using the  *mycelial network* which inhabits subspace. Obviously it has issues as we learn in the show (mostly caused by Lorca) but it's viable. Used correctly and  sparingly, you can jump to any location in the universe. Hammer and abuse it and then it's not only reality hopping but time hopping as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, it's not something we ever heard of in later Trek shows. You would think Janeway would have risked making and using one to get home. You'd even think that the Federation would adopt Spore drives when it's found that Warp travel is collapsing subspace in TNGs  ""Force of Nature"" episode. You can also be damn sure the Borg would give their left nipple nut for Spore Drive tech. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now...the easy hand wave scenario here is that the Spore Drive is abandoned and / or classified after whatever events take place in Discovery. Again, this makes no sense. The Federation knows it works  (it was their secret weapon against the Klingon's) and they know Lorca subverted it by keying in false co-ordinates under extreme circumstances to jump to the mirror universe (something they more than happily classified). We also know it jumped 9 months forward in time coming back.

&amp;#x200B;

So something has to happen for the Federation to 100% lock it down and classify it as unsafe and unusable during TOS and TNG era.  Thats the end result from the show (it has to be) and to me, it would be sad to see those sort of possibilities be removed from the Trek universe.  

&amp;#x200B;

So..I think the solution is easy.  Throw Discovery and key supporting cast members (say...Mirror  Georgiou, Tyler and  [L'Rell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5171438/characters/nm2371448?ref_=tt_cl_t12)  through time to a post Nemesis era.....say..20 years after and never EVER let them go back. Have it so the crew was assumed lost by the Federation + Klingon's  after their final Spore jump post TOS era with events that actually lead to the spore drive being classified and abandoned.  Maybe even have it so Picard is the one bringing them up to date. Eitherway, the crew can come back into the service of a newer Star Fleet / Klingon's whilst dealing with the loss of their family's. Maybe even have Worf bringing L'Rell up to date. The ship maybe gets a few minor overhall's (like a proper Holodeck) but is deemed sound enough to go back into exploratory service whilst Starfleet can re-open up the Spore drive for new shows.

&amp;#x200B;

If push really comes to shove, they can even use the Spore drive to resolve the Kelvin universe issue. Just needs some clever writing (since it seems unlikely to be resolved now).  

&amp;#x200B;

Eitherway...the Spore Drive is the problem and needs fixing without being abandoned imo.

&amp;#x200B;

Just a thought anyway.

We know Neelix was given a set of temporary holo-lungs. We know that people eat/drink and possibly even choke on smoke. So we know the replication of holo products is almost perfect.

Now taking inspiration from that weird line in ""blink of an Eye"", imagine a future where, a Woman lost her husband before they had kids, and she had sex with a holo-representation of her husband.

Now obviously everything about him is a holorecreation, but! Say she conceived in the holodeck and stayed in there for most, if not all, of the term. Assuming she only ate food from outside the holoeck her body would create a child using both her own and a holo-representation of her husbands DNA.

Now this child, would only have 1/2 of a cells worth of DNA that was now Holographic. The rest would have been made by the mother based on the original, due to cellular Mitosis.

Now say the woman steps out of the Holodeck with her child, it might suffer very slight cell death in a few hundred cells. But a baby is still developing and can compensate for that (not to mention future medical tech)

So the result would be a 100% organic child, from a mother and a holo-father.

"I’m really sorry, but I have to rant about “Cogenitor” again...So we know from the DS9 episode “Accession” that if a planet has a caste system of any kind, it is considered ineligible for membership to the federation. So what do you think happens to planets that meet all the technological and political requirements, but still discriminate against certain members of its population?




Let’s use the Vissians as an example. Their only appearance in the franchise was in the Enterprise episode “Cogenitor.” I’ve brought this episode up before, mainly because it infuriates me to no end (which might become apparent here.) I’m going to assume you’ve already seen the episode and are familiar with its contents. After watching it recently, I couldn’t help but wonder what would happen if the Vissians later applied for membership in the federation.




Imagine you’re a Vissian. Your civilization has practiced a form a sexual slavery for as long as your history records. It’s so accepted on your planet that no one ever questions it. One day, your planet’s government applies for membership into the Federation of Planets, the most powerful organization in the Alpha **and** Beta quadrants, with solid footholds in Delta and Gamma. Membership means security for your people, both on and off-world, a voice in galactic affairs, and access to the combined knowledge of thousands of unique civilizations.


Then it gets rejected.


And the reason why is made perfectly clear. The federation finds your treatment of the Cogenitors backwards and barbaric. Maybe they don’t say it like that, but they say it. So what does the average Vissian think now? Quintillion’s of people all looked at your society and said without hesitation “that’s backwards, barbaric, and wrong.” Does that give you pause?




The closest real life example of what I’m trying to describe would be apartheid. Most of the countries on earth utterly condemned what the South African government was doing to its black citizens. I’ve wondered before what it was like to be a supporter of apartheid at that time. The entire rest of the planet is telling you you’re the bad guy, how can you go on thinking that what you’re doing is right?



I’m sorry, this turned into another rant about an episode I’ve already ranted about multiple times. But at least this time, I’ve asked a question that I hope people on this this sub will find somewhat interesting.",0
"Tamarians in Discovery. Think it could work?I was rewatching TNG ""Darmok"" recently, where they mention that the Tamarians were first encountered by Starfleet about 100 years ago. It occurred to me that Discovery is right around that time period.

So, maybe Discovery could do an episode about First Contact with these guys?

But wait... that doesn't actually sound like fun. Nothing really exciting happened at the time, after all. They failed to crack the code of their language, nor was there any mention of a conflict. How would they give us an interesting episode without violating canon?

You make it the B plot, that's how. Put the focus of the episode on something else: crew relationships, recent events, some mundane problem that serves as a substrate for character development. First contact is one of those things that's seen as a big deal and they make whole episodes revolving around the clash of cultures and so on, but I find something amusingly appealing about doing a first contact episode where it's treated as just another day at the office. They spend a few hours trying to get to know these bizarre aliens who love their proper nouns so much, but eventually have to just give up before they say something offensive. Shaka, when the walls fell.

That would all be in the background. Most of the screen time would be about, I don't know, Burnham and Tilly debugging the translator and musing about the vagaries of life in space. I think it could really work as a breather episode. You know the kind I mean, like ""Captain's Holiday"" or ""In The Cards"". Something lighthearted to break up the more serious episodes.

I think it's a fun idea that I just wanted to share so everyone else can share in my disappointment when it never happens.",0
"It's sad, but TOS needs to go in order for Trek canon to fit more smoothly.As much as I love TOS, as much as I love TOS's unique aesthetic style that no other series has attempted to mimic (even when it really should), TOS just doesn't fit anymore.

Aesthetics aside, TOS has aged horribly on social issues. Yes, it was extremely progressive for its time *race wise* but its treatment of women was still rather appalling -- and note that TNG, DS9, even VOY and ENT also suffered from this in some respect. And to say that the Federation of TOS could even possibly be just 10 years after the significantly more progressive Federation of Discovery would be utterly insane.

Moving on from socio-political issues, TOS (and its sequel, TAS) also diverges from the rest of Trek canon significantly in many places. In ""Balance of Terror"" the Enterprise seems to fire phasers like torpedoes, and apparently requires a special ""Phaser Control"" room where crew members fire the weapons manually. Given that we see nothing like this in ENT, DIS, or anything that comes after TOS, this is a technical inconsistency. At another point, the Enterprise travels 1,000 lightyears at ordinary warp within just a few days -- Voyager could've gotten home much faster if that's how fast the *original* Enterprise could go. And there are many more that I could list but I want to avoid making a novel out of this.

Now, moving on to aesthetic issues. As much as I love the TOS aesthetic and think DIS should have respected it more, it should be noted that this aesthetic provides one of the biggest eyebrow-raising issues in all of TOS: Everything looks the same.
It would be one thing if the memorable TOS style was unique to Starfleet ships, but we see over the course of the series that Klingon ships, Romulan ships, ""Alien of the week"" ships, and even ancient human vessels like the Botany Bay all follow this aesthetic -- even though these are all vastly different cultures and situations behind construction, how do they look the same? That, along with the fact that many of the races we would later see in TNG and ENT appear in the stereotypical TOS makeup, even though later on the Klingons *and* Romulans would get their forehead ridges.
What this shows is that TOS doesn't really take itself seriously in many ways. We're supposed to suspect our disbelief that the aliens look like humans in light makeup and that all the interior scenes are made using recycled props and re-dressed sets and thus all look like they were built by the same race. And we're supposed to just ignore the countless glaring continuity errors, events that contradict later canon, and stories that should never have been written at all (Spock's Brain, anyone?). Within the larger scheme of the Star Trek cinematic universe, TOS is a trainwreck of errors that, though charming in its dated nature, and sentimentally valuable to fans, is doing more harm than good overall.

So here's what I suppose: CBS should declare the Original Series and its animated Spinoff to be in an alternate timeline of its own. Then they should reboot TOS as a modern show, they could pick out things to keep, and things to leave behind. Famous *good* episodes could be redone from the original script with only slight tweaks to fit better in canon, fix any politically ""sketchy"" material, and use the modern budget and effects to more closely achieve the original writer's original intentions for the episode (which they usually had to cut down), meaning we could have episodes like ""Balance of Terror"" ""City on the Edge of Forever"" ""The Trouble with Tribbles"" and ""All our Yesterdays"" redone with stunningly beautiful sets and effects, and vastly more expansive scopes. Stories that could've been good or were good, but were written poorly, could be thus rewritten to achieve their true potential. As well as entirely new episodes to replace the ones that are completely irretrievable -- imagine replacing ""Turnabout Intruder"" with something awesome. And let's not forget that TAS, too, had some good episodes. Those episodes could be remade in stunningly beautiful live-action.

This sort of change wouldn't be for everyone, of course. There are a lot of TOS purists who would rather have *everything else* declared non-canon so TOS could shine on its own. But I think that, by placing TOS and TAS in their own alternate timeline, CBS could ensure that both original shows remain canon, but separately from the rest -- this, I hope, would satisfy both sides of the aisle.

There would, still, be some issues reconciling such a change with larger Trek canon. As shows like ""Relics"", ""Trials and Tribble-ations"", and ""In a Mirror Darkly"" all feature TOS heavily. But it is possible that modern VFX could edit each one to fit the rebooted show, and that the updated version could come out with, say, a 60th anniversary remaster -- note that this would mean TNG, DS9, and ENT would all be getting remastered.

On a final note, such a rebooted show need not start with Kirk. We could instead start with a remake of ""The Cage"" and go for a few seasons of Anson Mount's Pike before making the switch to Kirk -- this would, I imagine, cool the tempers of some fans by letting them get into the show while it was covering unexplored territory, which would make it easier for them to accept the eventually paving-over of TOS. Perhaps a seven-season run would be good -- two seasons for Pike's command, the episodes spread out over a long time span and another five for Kirk's famous Five Year Mission.

Anyway, what do you think? Should TOS be separated from Prime Canon? Would you watch such a reboot show? Do you think CBS would make a good show out of the reboot, Or would they fudge it terribly?

Edit: Well, the DIS hate here is rather astonishing. And the fact that, when faced with glaring inconsistencies in a story, everybody goes ""who cares, it's fictional"" is very disappointing to me as an amateur writer. If these people wrote TV shows, there would probably be no continuity at all.

Also, I must further remind you people that I'm talking about giving TOS it's own timeline to live in, separate from TNG. By doing this, you instantly resolve most of the inconsistencies in Trek canon without removing anything from canon. TOS remains canon, but in the same way that the Kelvin timeline is canon -- perhaps even with a point of divergence established. It also opens up the chance for us to relive some of the better moments of TOS with superior effects and improved production quality via the remake.",0

Star Trek showerthought: John Torres must have been a huge SM freak,0
"Can Data be cloned?Let me pose a hypothetical question. 

Can Data be cloned?

Let's say I were to take the basic Star Trek transporter technology and combine it with their replicator technology to create a machine that can clone any object. Put an item in the transporter and it gets transported from one pad to another. The object is turned into a massive amount of data in the pattern buffer. That data is sent to the other pad where the transporter rematerialized the item. 

At the same time, what if that same information in the pattern buffer was sent to a replicator? The replicator uses the information to create that same object. And there you go, you have an original sitting on the transporter pad and a replica sitting in the replicator.

Now who knows if you could use such a theoretical machine on a person. Whatever comes out of the replicator might be a living breathing person...or it could be a lifeless pile of organic tissue. That's a discussion for another time, but what about Data? 

He's a machine. So whatever comes out of the replicator, would be an exact clone. Either it could be an exact duplicate with all of data's memories in tact, or it would be a technical replica only. A completely clean, brand new positronic brain that is ready to either be dissected so they could figure out how it works, or ready to be programmed with a new personality.

"Ten Forward Friday [8/24]Ahoy hoy fellow Trekkies and Trekkers!

We've decided to run a little experiment. As our sub has grown and grown over the last year (at the moment we're averaging around 100 new subscribers a day!), we've started to feel like it's become less like a community and more like a bunch of strangers getting together to talk about something they're interested in. Which is fine, but we'd like to bring back a bit of that family feeling and get to know each other a bit better.

So we will be trying out having an ""off topic"" post, pinned to the top of the sub for a day or so every week, where users can gather, have a tall glass of prune juice or Romulan Ale, and talk about how things are going and what you're doing/looking forward to/cooking/playing/watching. Depending on how it goes and the schedules for the new Trek shows, it might move around the week a bit (and because Ten Forward Tuesday sounds better tbh).

--------------------------

**Ten Forward Rules**

* No politics! While we appreciate that this is a topic on everyone's minds in one way or another, for now we'd like to not have to sit and fight fires in this thread. This rule might change in the future but for the moment please don't directly discuss politics here.

* Non-Trek related talk is encouraged! Feel free to discuss your other favorite sci fi shows, your awesome new sneakers, share photos of your dog, etc. While we won't be policing the thread, if you do want to talk about Trek it's probably better to do that elsewhere in the sub.

* No memes/shitposting. That's what /r/risa is for.

* Wheaton's Law applies, of course. Don't be a dick.

"Shocked by how good ENT isI've never bothered to watch Enterprise before as I heard it was the worst series and the theme music did my head in.  However with little to watch on Netflix, I gave it try number 5.

And boy was I stupid.  I love this series.  Just on season 1 episode 18ish at the moment but so much about it is great.  The pre Federation Starfleet,  the submarine like design of the ship, dealing with recoil when they fired their first laser cannon, a story stretched across a season,  the experienced Boomers vs inexperienced Starfleet dynamic, the Vulcan perspective.   Even the characters - Archer is a brilliant captain.  He's moral but unsure about it, curious but cautious, desperate to prove himself and his species to the galaxy.  Wildly entertaining and highly relatable.  The Doctor is a charming character as are Trip and Malcolm in their own way.  Lewis seems to be the Wesley or Harry of this series but I can handle that.  And some of the T'Pal scenes seem sexually exploitative.

Can't believe I never gave it a try.  It really feels like you're watching historic events unfold.  Really surprised by the quality.",0

"My Opinion on Star TrekTOS has a great first and arguably second season, but a lacklustre third.

TNG has terrible first and second seasons. Yes, there are a few gems, but fifty-two, hour-long episodes is a slog to get through for only a handful of decent ones. Season three to seven, however, are my personal favourite Trek.

DS9 also starts slow yet the first and second seasons are actually watchable. Season three to seven are also amazing Trek and arguably tied with TNG for the best. Duet is my favourite Trek episode of all time.

VOY is fine with some gems. It’s standout seasons are four and five, but the others are still good and perfectly watchable. My favourite part of VOY is Elite Force.

ENT is half and half. The first two seasons are fine with some gems and the final two seasons are great. Just be sure to stop watching at the second to last episode. Terra Prime is a much better finale than These are the Voyages

DSC is also fine. The production value is spectacular and the storytelling is good, but not up to the highs of Trek.",0
"A question on phasers and beaming awayI noticed that whenever an away team beams away to a dangerous place, fully expecting they might engage the enemy early on (e.g. rescue missions), most often they would put their phasers to stun, holster it, then beam away. Once materialized on the other side, right off the bat they get their phasers from its holster and proceed thereafter. 

Wouldn’t it be much wiser if they just don’t holster their phasers in the first place when beaming away? Of course, this would only apply in certain situations that call for it. That’s one less step for them to take and it’s much safer security-wise.

I understand that this might be Starfleet protocol, but still.",0

"I wish they would make Star Trek 4 without Chris PineI might be in the minority on this, unfortunately (downvotes off the starboard bow!), but I'm curious to see. I think it could be great. They really do need to reduce the budgets of these movies--they're never going to be billion dollar blockbusters--and if an already wealthy man can't understand that, get rid of him. It would send a message to other rich actors who think they're too big for their britches. I mean how greedy can you be? 

Every setback can be an opportunity. It's a fantastical science fiction world after all, they can do anything. This is a chance to do something weird like, as I've seen many suggest, a transporter accident that ages him into William Shatner, or a body swap into another Trek alum like Jeffrey Combs... or why not Jeri Ryan? She's already proven to be fantastic at that as we saw from the time the Doctor was uploaded into Seven of Nine. I have no problem seeing a known Trek actor take on another role, hell, Combs did that plenty of times. It could be really fun seeing Kirk, a known womanizer, having to deal with the looks and attention he gets from the crew, dealing with the issues that women have to contend with, like men not wanting to take orders from her, or encountering a male dominated sexist society that they have to work with to achieve a goal. Maybe he suddenly finds the skirts the women wear objectifying (I'm sure he would feel very uncomfortable in one of those) and changes the uniforms. Yes, they already did a male/female swap with Kirk in Turnabout Intruder, but that was awful. You can still get the Kirk charisma and rapport with the crew with a different actor. They could get a great, modern sci-fi writer like NK Jemisin to write the screenplay.

I hope they abandon the 'Kirk meets his Dad' story anyway, that sounds like a terrible idea. Just go back to the drawing board and create something new and in the spirit of Star Trek: smart, thought-provoking science fiction. ",0
"I’m sorry but I found Star Trek: Discovery horribleI really wanted to like this show but in the first 20 minutes of the first episode, I was very disappointed and even angry at it. It does, however carry name Star Trek and so I gave it several chances and midway through the season I found it to be tolerable, even likable. Did it ever “feel” like Star Trek to me? No, but I thought perhaps it could in time.

And then I watched the last few episodes. My God what a mess. Twists for shock value, for the sake of having twists. It felt like the show had no idea where it was going with it. I was woefully disappointed like I had been during the first episode.

The sad thing is the show has AMAZING characters. Saru, Tilly, Lorca were all well-developed and well acted. Seriously stellar performances from those actors. We could have further explored their motivations and personalities. Instead we got shitty plot twists that make no sense.

And then what they did with Lorca...so immensely disappointing. He was complex, driven, gritty. A wartime Starfleet captain whose ends justify the means. A Star Trek antihero.

And they took that idea and shattered it with a dumb plot twist.

To me Star Trek has always been exploring the human condition with a view towards the future seen in a positive light. Maybe that’s just me favoring TNG but that’s what it’s always been for me. This show was nothing like that. It felt empty and soulless. In these crazy times I think we need a little less dystopia and a lot more TNG. A lot more Picard.

And yet it makes me really nervous about the new Picard show. ",0
"Is it me, or do pregnancies and disaster go hand in hand in Star Trek?Molly O'Brian was born during an Enterprise crippling disaster, Naomi Wildman during a near-destruction Voyager event, even the birth of Kirk during the film Star Trek (2009) saw the destruction of the USS Kelvin. What a strange coincidence.",0
"Which series to watch next?I'm a long time Star Trek fan, but I should note that this mainly included TOS and TNG. I grew up watching TOS reruns and the films as a kid and watched all of TNG from start to finish during its initial run. I watched the first season and part of the second of DS9, but lost interest in it a bit, and due to life changes (graduating from high school, joining the military, getting married, etc.) I just never got back into watching Star Trek while any series were still around.

Fast forward a couple of decades, and about two years ago I decided to start watching DS9, as I finally had the time and the means to do so (thanks Netflix!). Although I took a long break from it in the middle of the series, I just now finished watching it in its entirety. Oh boy, what I missed from back in the day. DS9 most certainly belongs in the pantheon of great Star Trek series.

However, this has all left me with a bit of a conundrum. I haven't seen much of Voyager or Enterprise beyond a handful of episodes of each. Although I've seen no episodes of Voyager that I've liked (beyond the pilot), Enterprise held my attention the little that I've been able to see of it. Of course, knowing how Star Trek series tend to go, you can't judge a whole series by just a couple of episodes.

So, this all leads me to my question. Which series should I watch next, Voyager or Enterprise? From my understanding, Voyager is the weakest of the Star Trek series, whereas Enterprise is the shortest, with the exception being TOS. Which series do you guys think will disappoint me the least, especially after just watching DS9?",0
"Dukat’s Big DayMinor spoilers for DS9? I don’t know. Here’s my script.

Sisko is going hyper-minigolfing with Jake and Kasidy. Dukat decides the Pah-Wraiths want him to ruin Sisko’s day. 

He disguises himself as Kai Winn to get close to Sisko and stab him. But all the Bajorans are crowding him at the minigolf, because they think he’s kai winn. Sisko notices a ruckus in the background but thinks nothing of it. Dukat is stymied and yells his new catchphrase “those accursed Bajorans!”.  No one thinks it’s weird, because that’s very normal behavior for Kai Winn. (Dukat remains in the Kai’s clothes the whole episode, but from this point on they get dirtier and more torn each time we see him.)

Dukat goes to get some Bajoran crocogators from the water area of the golf course. He sneakily sprays some crocogator bait on Sisko’s golf club. But Dukat’s holding the bottle backwards! He gets covered in the spray, and the gators attack him. He repeats his catchphrase. 

It’s the 18th hole, a windmill. Dukat is hiding on the other side of the windmill, so he can replace Sisko’s ball with an exploding one. Right as the ball comes through the windmill, the spinny part catches his underwear. He is lifted into the air with a gigantic wedgie. Sisko gets a hole in one. “Those accursed Bajoran’s!”

The minigolf owners take the Emissary’s hole in one as a sign from the Prophets. They arrange a big feast. Dukat gets a cold fusion drilling machine. He’s going to undermine the foundations of the Feast Hall and kill everyone inside. 

He takes a wrong turn and gets out of the drill to investigate. He’s in the maintenance shed! One of the workers left a bunch of rakes lying around. Dukat stumbles from one to the other, getting hit in the face by each one. 

‘Those accursed Baj-‘, but just then, the drill machine that Dukat left running causes the shed to collapse on him. 

Cut to Quark’s. Jake and Sisko are telling the gang about the great time they had. Worf mentions that a maintenance shed was sabotaged; Starfleet Intelligence suspects the Dominion. Odo says if that’s the best they can do, they aren’t up to par. Everyone laughs. 

We see Dukat in a Bajoran hospital. He’s in a full body cast with a hot water bag on his head and a thermometer in his mouth. Muffled by the cast and the thermometer, he wearily mumbles “those accursed Bajorans...”",0
"Star Trek ContinuesI just discovered this on Youtube, would never really consider myself one to watch fan films (besides Axanar, which I love), but Star Trek Continues is amazing. It really feels like they discovered some lost episodes of TOS (which I've been watching for the first time too, recently - I probably would not appreciate this as much if not for watching TOS).

Okay, sure, I've seen some complain about the acting but come on. Although I haven't watched every episode, the ones I have watched, except for a few parts, feel like if you just swapped out the actors for the real actors, they would be genuine episodes of the 1960s show. It feels and looks like TOS.

A really great accomplishment. I just watched the one with John De Lancie, and it was a really interesting look at racism done in a pretty brilliant way (i.e., the writing is excellent and makes you think, just like the best of Trek). Everything about this series is amazing to me. I can't get over it. Hence my post.

"No hats for Starfleet uniforms?Most militaries and police services have hats as part of their uniforms, and while Starfleet is neither a military or a police service they have always had uniforms and dress uniforms much like them, so how come Starfleet doesn't do hats? 

I'm fairly new to Star Trek (my introduction was the Kelvin Timeline and Discovery, but I'm making progress in TNG and it's my favourite Trek thus far) so I don't know if they ever wear hats as part of their uniforms - and honestly the thought of Picard in a military-style hat does seem rather silly.

"Watching Enterprise season 3 for the first timeI've always kind of ignored Enterprise. Recently I decided I'd give it another go (couldn't be worse than DISCO).

I started with the first season and I liked some episodes in there. For some reason Terra Nova has the most detailed showing of an alien species in any Star Trek episode, or am I crazy? Haven't seen that often that we see such a detailed culture in a one-episode species (although they weren't even aliens). A lot of Enterprise plots seem to revolve about Archer getting captured though. Then Reed wants to shoot up the place, but they decide for another plan. Other plots revolve around T'Pol looking extremely pissed off (the episode with the rape-hippie-Vulcans being the climax).

Enterprise got kind of formulaic, so I skipped a lot of season 2.
Season 3 was amazing though. They got that really right with the constant threat of the Expanse, being pretty much isolated from other ships and the main arc was pretty solid. I liked the mystery of the spheres. The characters finally got to shine and many got through an evolution. Watching DISCO before this, I think they tried to achieve something similar with DISCO S1 (but failed IMO). 

Enterprise managed to have a great main arc and great single episodes. DISCO didn't achieve both. 

But now for the bad things in ENT S3:

- Too much time travel. We have single plots about time travel, the main arc is heavily time travel influenced and I think that's just a bad writing element. Archer heard of the Federation before founding it, so who really invented it? At least we get T'Pol in a driveway tho

- The finale was amazing imo. The crew is at the end of their powers and want to return home. But no: THEY TIME TRAVELED

- Ultimately this could have played after Voyager or whenever. The crew has some minor problems because it's so early in Star travel but this doesn't make too much of a difference. Vortexes get introduced and this seems like post-warp-technology... We also get a planet-destroying weapon... So lots of advanced technology.

Anyways, I can only recommend this to everyone who wasn't watched it.",0

Ok, a timeship from the Federation's future gets flung back in time in an attack which affects their temporal navigation system. The entire crew dies. The ship steers for help from anyone who may have already had knowledgeable experience with the Federation Time Agents. 

Captain Archer, newly retired from the Enterprise is beamed aboard the ship as it departs. Archer awakes, finding himself trapped in the past, wearing a portable holographic projector generating faces that are not his own, driven by a temporal prime directive to change history for the better.  His only guide on this journey is AI, a future version of an E.C.H., who appears in the form of a hologram.

Ira Steven Behr Reveals How He Really Wanted ‘Star Trek: Deep Space Nine’ To End + More DS9 At STLV 2018,0
"Voyager: Shattered questionSo in the episode Voyager becomes divided into several time frames. Go to one area of the ship and your back before the caretaker, go to a different area and your during Seska’s siege of the ship. Well at the end when they get all of the pieces put back together, how is it that Chakotay is the only one with full recollection of the event? All of them had the same antidote as he so that they could cross time frames. The only explanation is that because they merged back as one in the time he’s from that some how that makes him special. However the plan totally depended on him having intact memory of the event to configure the deflector dish when he returns so that the temporal accident never occurs. How did they know for sure that he would remember? There’s no way of knowing that. Also how did they know for sure that he’d be dumped off before the accident occurred? I might just assume that it would dump him back off at the moment it happened.

Also one final question, why would telling Janeway about what happened go against the temporal prime directive? The event was wiped from continuity so he wouldn’t be spoiling anything by telling her. The only thing that maybe he couldn’t tell her is about the future time frame with Naomi and Icheb. Everything else though should be fair game.",0
I love Michael Dorn's eye work with WorfHe is so incredibly expressive with his eyes. There are a ton of great moments in the show when Worf is thinking something over (particularly when it relates to his Klingon heritage) that he'll have these intensely focused eyes. Sometimes they will drift between wide-open crazy eyes and slighty pulsing squints. I think it's a brilliant acting choice. It's reads to me as a sign that inside Worf is wrestling between his Klingon heritage and his human upbringing / how humans feel about something.,0
"Theory about the Mycelial network and the Omega moleculeSo I recently re-watched The Omega Directive episode of Voyager and I theorize that this could be the answer to the Mycelial network problem introduced in Discovery. In this episode, we find out that a molecule called Omega can irreparably damage subspace if it becomes unstable, thereby rendering warp drive useless. But I suspect that the first Omega explosion also caused the Mycelial network to collapse/die. Since the Omega molecule damages subspace, and the Mycelial network exists in subspace, it wouldn't be that far fetched to assume that the first Omega explosion on the Starfleet research station caused a subspace chain reaction that spread through the Mycelial network neutralizing it.

"My take on Discovery Era shipsFirst, let me say that as a lifelong fan, I actually really dig the Starfleet we see in Discovery. It's gritty and sharp. But it doesn't mesh well with the Constitution-style ships that defined the TOS era. Why the difference?

I think there's an assumption in Trek fandom that ships evolve with technology. The Galaxy-class is so much bigger than the Constitution because we eventually figured out how to make a ship that big. The saucers are swept because it was somehow more useful than the blockier versions of the past.

I don't think this is necessarily the case. 

Three things affect starship design: Technology, Requirement, and Stylistic Choice.

**Tech**

Yes, tech advancement certainly comes into play. Mostly with the engines, I'd assume. But this wouldn't explain why things get bigger. As tech advances, it usually gets smaller. The difference between the size of the Sovereign nacelle and an Intrepid nacelle are huge, and yet their top speeds are pretty comparable. A Nova class is tiny, but still goes pretty fast. The engines have to be sufficient to deal with the size of the ship.

The STO explanation for why the Sovereign and Vesta are so narrow is because the slipstream tunnel they can utilize takes much less energy to sustain if it's got a smaller diameter, but tech advancements really take a back seat to the requirements for the ship.

**Requirement**

Constitutions are smaller than a Crossfield (which I suspect is an advanced refit of a much older ship), because they should be. They're battle-cruisers designed to take on a D7. They're no frills. They need to be quick and sustainable. Galaxies are huge because they're deep space explorers designed to house a small city of families. It's a peacetime ship. When a wartime ship is needed, the Sovereign offers a smaller, more compact target, fewer weak points, like the vulnerable neck, etc, and yet is large enough to transport armies, escort convoys, stand in line of battle, and handle the firepower it's got without shaking itself apart.

When we watch Discovery, what are we looking at? We're looking at a Starfleet that's about 100 years old, and has been more or less at peace throughout that time. Ask any grunt what the peacetime quality of their equipment is, and it sucks. Remember in the Iraq war when stories came out of soldiers strapping hunks of metal to their transports as extra armor because they didn't have modern available armor. Rumsfeld said ""You go to war with the army you have,"" and he was right. Peacetime forces generally run on old equipment and tech. These ships are old. They're explorer craft. They're not designed for war. And in Disco they're getting destroyed at a fast clip. Meanwhile they're building Connies, a war ship. Mirandas, a war ship. Someone's drawing early designs for the Excelsior on a cocktail napkin right about now. I'm betting these will be phased out, and we'll see newer, more recognizable ships phase in.

**Style**

Humans are artistic, probably more than we're practical. When we see these ships, we're looking at stylistic zeitgeists of the time. The Disco ships are art deco. Bronze coloring, straight, overlapping lines, engines in sharp points. Do they NEED to be like that? Probably not. But somewhere on Earth is a head designer of San Francisco Fleetyards who's signature style was art deco starships. And some young buck whose sensibilities steer toward Atomic Era design is coming in. ""Hey, why not round nacelles and military gray?""  


Style doesn't evolve, it just changes. Brutalist architecture is hundreds of years more advanced than Gothic architecture but one is hardly the evolved form of the other. Starfleet had an Art Deco era, and Atomic Era, a Militaristic Era, an Organic Era, etc. And they'll change again.",0

"Ok so I was thinking about this the other day about Star Trek and decided to share this with you to see what some of your thoughts were.This is going to push your star trek knowledge so bear with me.

I was thinking about Commander Data, and how even though he is a fantastic technical design that was basically one of a kind (besides Lore and B4 if you have to count him).  He was the culmination of a scientists dream who wanted to make a being who would learn and better himself through experience as Data had even though Soong knew himself that he (Soong) was flawed.  

Then I remembered the TOS episode I Mudd.  The android Norman I think seemed even more complex.  He had desires and ambitions, and the idea that he and his android race were needed to “take care of humans” by serving them.  Norman was of course defeated by Kirk and Company.

Two very different androids to say the least.

The thing I just thought about though is that there were no references to the remaining androids.  What do you think happened to them.  Kirk mentioned that they reverted back to their original programming of geological work and they were tasked to also keep Harry Mudd out of space (with a bunch of X wife androids).

Does anyone wonder what happened to the rest of the androids?  There is no reason to assume they wouldn’t be functioning during the time of Data.  I was just curious.",0

"As much as your speculations for the new picard series ain't going to happen the way you think, it's still fun reading speculative plots, keep it going&amp;#x200B;",0
"Why the new Picard show will not involve a mission to save SiskoIf there’s one thing Star Trek fans love to do, it’s speculate. How does this thingababob work?  How does a species have a language based on stories, with no way to explain what individual words mean?  How functional is Data?

So it stands to reason that speculation hits a fever pitch when they announce a new show with the return of Picard. People have been dying for a return to the post-TNG era, and we’re finally going to get it. 

But some seem to think this will be something of a sequel to the old shows:

“Picard is living with Vash on an empty planet, working at an archaeological site. Captain Nog shows up with his holographic first Officer, Vic Fontaine. They join Geordi and Seven of Nine on an adventure with the Traveler to rescue Sisko from the wormhole. The only thing that stands in their way is a team of Dukat, Species 8472, and Sela. Garak arrives on the Titan, but can he be trusted?  Only HoloData as the ship’s computer can say for sure!”

I think the ties to past shows will only happen in passing. CBS isn’t going to launch a new show that’s dependent on someone having seen 700+ episodes of older shows. 

I imagine there will be little Easter eggs and cameos here and there to make us happy, but they’re not going to make past events pivotal pieces of the plot. They’ll want this new show to be open for new viewers — people who only have a passing knowledge of TNG and the other shows — and they’re certainly not going to want to bog it down with lengthy scenes of exposition where they explain storylines from 30 years ago. 

Personally, I’ll just be happy to see Picard back on the screen. As long as he rips into someone with a speech about ethics and morals, I’ll count it as a success. ",0

-DS9 would be interesting post-911, when ENT was made.  Would make it perfect for the times not ""before its time.""  Plus, HD and effects.

-ENT would work better in the early 90s before ""franchise fatigue"" and wouldn't have been criticized as ""safe"" or unambitious.

-VOY would work well now, I think.  That story could be told far better in the new darker, grittier era of TV with more serialization.

"Uniforms in VoyagerFeeling inspired by the recent Troi's thread, I'd like to share my own idea about an issue in Voyager existing since the original run of the show. 
When I first watched the series I was little more than a kid and had almonst an obsession with the Borg. 
When Seven joined I was ecstatic (a Borg character who isn't a villain *and* is an attractive woman? 10/10 for my brain). 

Soon though it bothered me to no end that she didn't wear a uniform. At first it was because I simply like uniforms and having Seven wearing one would feel like she was truly part of the crew and later, growing up, also because I felt Seven would have tried to mix with the Voyager crew to feel once again in a group of identical individuals. 

I disliked the fact that the Maquis started wearing uniforms, a symbol of what they were fighting, while the lone ex-Borg striving for a collective would wear a pretty unique and revealing one piece. 

I would have loved Seven wearing a uniform, exploring the ideas that wearing the same outfit of your colleagues brings and her bonding with the crew. 

The fanservice aspect could have been kept in particular scenes, there would be quite a few ways to insert some eye candy moments without having Jeri Ryan wear a skintight for the whole series (I'm not against fanservice per se, but I prefer it to be the exception in a show and to be used only when the context is sound. Also fanservice with men isn't a bad idea).

The episode starts with the crew bored out of their minds while traveling through nothingness for months with two more years to go. Morale is dropping quickly, partly driven by the absence of Capt. Janeway who has secluded herself from the crew due to her intense guilt over getting the crew into this position.

"The Drumhead: re-evaluating in the light of Discovery
I was rewatching *The Drumhead* the other night.  It gives me chills how eerily prescient the episode was, and depressingly so given that it used our past as inspiration.   But there is a tidbit that is often overlooked.  A morsel that is hidden behind the feast of Picard’s speech and Admiral Satie.   


J’Dan.  A rarity in TNG era Klingons.  First, a scientist.  The is sadly a job that is way underrepresented in our dealing with Klingons.  After all, they do have to have brilliant minds to design and maintain their amazing ships. 


He does not dress in the typical Klingon fashion, perhaps due to his extended exchange with the Federation.  Kurn still wore his uniform, but perhaps J’Dan was never a member of the KDF.   Still, a Klingon in civilian clothes and wearing a *Federation* combadge is an unusual sight. 


Third, he is a spy.  He appear to be working with the Romulans, but also has (or claims) high connections in Klingon society.  (I am glad they didn’t explicitly link him to the Duras family). Klingon Intelligence is mentioned and seen on DS9, and TOS has a couple examples of Klingon spies. But TNG didn’t as much. 


He has one very key line that made me think of his place in the overarching Klingon story:


J'DAN: The blood of all Klingons has become water. Since the Federation alliance we have turned into a nation of mewling babies. Romulans are strong. They are worthy allies. They do not turn Klingons into weaklings like you. 



It is almost as if he believes that the Federation will corrupt, has corrupted the Empire, yet with the Romulans they will “Remain Klingon”.  



T’Kuvma’s belief was nothing new in DSC, but perhaps just the earliest chronological appearance.  


T’Kuvma. Chang. J’Dan. All trying in their own way to recapture glory days that perhaps never were...


(And ultimately, failing since we know the Klingon empire officially joins the Federation by Daniel’s time in ENT).

"The Borg. How would you handle them, then and now?(Imagine it’s 1987) Congratulations!  You’ve just been hired on as the lead Borg designer and decision maker for TNG, as well as the following shows, DS9 and VOY.

Their mix of organic tissue and fast replicating technology fuels their slow, unstoppable, terrifying drive to assimilate all known life into their collective.  They are perfectly set up to be “The Boogeyman” instilling foreboding and dread into space explorers and viewers alike.

And given Picard made them aware of the future events, they could well be in a successful marriage too.

Not that I'd want the new series to feel it has to be tied down to too much backstory for fear of it alienating new viewers, I just thought it'd be an interesting change to see Picard at a different phase of his life demonstrating a new confidence in that area. 

Now, of course it doesn't have to be an on-screen relationship, there's been no announcement about any other TNG co-stars apart from Stewart on the show, but it could be a character detail that's kept off-screen, opening up the possibility of Picard being married to Crusher, Vash, Lower Decks Commander, Insurrection older woman or, shock horror, someone original. 

I guess the TL;DR question I'm asking here is: Do you want Picard to be exactly the same, buttoned down, socially awkward singleton he was in TNG, or perhaps slightly more open in that regard to be able to hold down a relationship?",0

"Watching TOS for the First Time. Wow! I am surprised at how great it is!I didn't like Star Trek until watching TNG in college.  I then watched all of TNG, DS9, and Voyager in the course of about a year.  This was in the 2000's, so those shows were only about 5-15 years old at the time.  In the years after, every time I tried to watch TOS, I was put off by the clear age of the show.  It seemed like it was just going to be cheesy and bad.  Hokey stories with overly dramatic Shatner...ACTING.

"Been a Trek fan for 30 years - and I'm finally watching The Animated SeriesI did a rewatch of TOS while listening to the Mission Log podcast, then decided it was time to keep going and take the plunge on TAS. I'd never felt a burning need to watch it, but at the same time - it's Star Trek, and it's new to me!

I can see both why it's worth watching and why so many people skip it.

The good: The plots are very Star Trek-y, but without the bloat that made some episodes feel like they took forever to get anywhere. ""Yesteryear"" fills in a lot of Spock's backstory, and ""More Tribbles, More Trouble"" is basically ""The Trouble With Tribbles"" without the INTERMINABLE bar fight. Even the episodes that are just okay have both a lot to chew on philosophically and entertainment value.

The bad: The animation is really dated and cheap looking. There's no way around it, and you just have to accept it if you're going to watch. The voice work is also really stiff, as if nobody is talking to anyone else - likely because the cast was rarely together to record. There are also weird continuity errors and a tendency to make up technobabble to fill in gaps in the stories.

Overall, it's worth watching, as long as you know what you're getting in to. Plus at just 22 episodes, it's not much of a time commitment. ",0
"The Voyager MovieInspired by the recent thread about Garrett's desire for a Voyager movie, here's my idea of how they could have managed it, or perhaps even still could.

Start by deriving some urgent crisis in the Delta quadrant which Starfleet has to respond to.  And logically, what team has the most experience with that region of space and the McGuffin in question? The Voyagers!

This would make for a great addition to the story without having to alter the show.

The first part of the movie could briefly show what everyone had been up to since their return in the short scenes in which Janeway has to ""get the band back together.""  

And add the risk that they may get stuck in the Delta quadrant again; we've managed to jerry-rig some device that can get them there, but it only works from our end so the return plan is dubious and dependent on success.

Janeway is resigned to go, although she has a lot of sighing and eye rolling going along with it.

She recruits Tuvok and Barclay first; they don't hesitate to sign on.  Seven agrees, but not without protest; perhaps there is a specific threat to her.

But no one else is so easy.  Tom and B'Elanna have a family; can they leave their kids? Do they bring them along?  Each agrees that surely they can be replaced, but Janeway always gets her way.  Also, Tom has lost a lot of hair. 

Chakotay agrees, but only because he wants to support Janeway and Seven. Perhaps he protests, but when Seven agrees he acquiesces.
Hacoochimoya. 

Or hell, maybe Seven is lost and in danger in the Delta and that's the inciting action in the first place.

Maybe bringing the Doctor along is only possible if he is resigned to sick bay once again, for some reason they can't take his emitter.  He doesn't like this idea, but he owes everything to his family.  He's a doctor, not a commando.

Kim flat out refuses.  He has a completely perfect life in every way.  It looks like the trip will go without him--until a last minute change of heart has him walk on to the bridge just before departure where he takes a new post since he's a Lt. now.

Maybe they could even run into Neelix upon arrival or find that Kes is involved in the threat. 

Anyway, that's how the movie is setup.  Hell, they could still do it all these years later.

The first 20 minutes could be basically a comedy as Janeway rallies her reluctant crew.

Then they go- and chaos and disaster immediately upon arrival for the next hour when they finally save the day and somehow get home again.  During all of this, the dynamics are different now-the crew is fighting amongst themselves, they all blame each other for various problems and especially Janeway for getting them back into this mess! 

Upon returning home, the crew has patched up their differences and even feel nostalgic for the old days.  Maybe they'll stick together for a while.  Maybe one more adventure...

Voyager 2: The Wrath of Kes

Voyager 3: The Search for Tuvok.

Voyager 4: The Voyage Home...again, but first time traveling and getting whales

Voyager 5:  Janeway beats up God, in the Delta Quadrant 

Voyager 6: The Final Peace accords with..the Borg!? 

I think that CBS recently got the message loud and clear that people want more Trek.  And by year's end they'll merge with Paramount as a ploy to have a more valuable company to eventually get bought by Disney.  So it's not too late!!!

"How are Vulcans and Romulans sister civilizations when neither had warp drive until recently?Is this explained anywhere? I've always been curious about this, and if I recall there was even a TNG episode about ancient romulan and vulcan artifacts being spread across an entire sector. Romulans I am less clear on, but I thought Vulcans didn't develop warp drive until after they forsook emotion and embraced logic.",0
"Your opinion, most worthless main cast character. Any series.Okay, so everybody has their favorites.  The ones that make the show great, or even the ones that always save the day.

Who, in your opinion, was the most useless or unnecessary main cast character?  The one that was annoying, hollow, pointless, or just generally didn’t contribute much to the show.  Or even, that one character that had that one story arc, that was completely out of left field and never mentioned again. Which leads me to my vote:

Kes.  She seemed kinda shoehorned in from the start.  Like, “Hey Meg Ryan is popular, kinda.  Let’s get a lookalike.”  I think the main thing that annoyed me though, was her psychic rage that she managed to suppress with the power of friendship, like a bad anime.  And then she left.

I was out and about recently when I was able to acquire two Star Trek Statues (Spock and Worf). I purchased these to add to my collection and to possibly turn a profit on them eventually however after a lot of searching I was not able to find any details on these. I believe that they are around 3 1/2 inches and are from approx 2006 as suggested by the trademark on the base on the bottom of the stand. If anyone knows of these statues and value I would greatly appreciate it If i could have some details.

"Do spaceships have outside doors?I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question. 

Basically the title. I’ve watched a lot of episodes of TNG and VOY with my grandpa while I was growing up. I recently started watching TOS and intend to watch all things Star Trek eventually. But enough backstory on myself, I was just trying to explain that I have seen a fairly decent amount of Star Trek. 

Anyways, do spaceships have doors for people to get on and off the ship, or do they always have to beam on and off the ship? Several episodes ago in TOS, Kirk states that it’s takes over 400 people to run a federation ship. So when they staff the ships for the first time, does all the crew have to beam on in groups of 5 or 6? Or is there a more efficient way of getting everyone on board? 

I know this is a pointless question, but I was just thinking about it and couldn’t find an answer online. Thanks for any answers! ",0

"The Next Generation Watchlist for Newcomers and RebingersEven though TNG is held in high regard there are certain episodes almost everyone of us would (advise to) skip, like ""Code of Honor"", ""Shades of Gray"" and ""Sub Rosa"" as prominent examples. I myself never watched the series straight from beginning to end, but nonetheless have seen most episodes at least twice by now, many even more often. This show consists of over 150 hours of filmed material what can surely feel intimidating to newcomers. And while I would advise to eventually watch all of them at least once, because there are good scenes to find in most episodes, it may be beneficial to stick to the essentials on first watch. TNG is an episodic show, but there are certain plotlines that get touched on frequently and along which one can get the bigger picture quite well.

"question about replicators, specifically in VoyagerSo we know that replicators convert energy into matter, and we have seen instances where people have recycled things back into the replicator, for instance Molly putting her dishes back into the replicator on DS9. In The Year of Hell, Janeway tells Chakotay to recycle the pocket watch he replicated for her birthday because it represented a pair of boots, a hypo, or a meal. So with that in mind, why couldn't Voyager just collect some inedible plants or rocks from a planet, recycle them into the replicator and use that energy to create something they needed, instead of giving out replicator rations due to energy conservation? Could they only recycle things that were originally replicated? ",0

So I've been itching for more Star Trek and more reading, so naturally I am interested in any good Star Trek books.

Now, I've always been heavily interested with Science Fiction movies, novels and tv shows. And Star Trek is one of those that I've always had my eyes on but never really went with watching them or read any of the novels. Instead of googling random articles or wiki's. I've sort of decided to take it to Reddit and what better alternative is to ask the subreddit itself.

I've seen a maybe one or two Star Trek movies, in the past few years, maybe 2011 iirc but remember that one vaguely. But recently watched Beyond, and I loved it. Though kinda didn't get some things like Ambassador Spock and younger Spock, also watched Discovery, actually binged it and I loved that one.

I'd like to get into the TV show side of things. Like where to start, whats the best TV series by popular opinion or smth like that, I've always been so conflicted on where to begin and if I should follow chronological order, same goes for movies and maybe books/novels.

Tl:dr. Where to start with TV Shows, whats most exciting and engaging etc by pop opinions or w/e, same for movies and books.

"So I got to Voyagerroll it back, basically I've been making an effort to watch all the core star Trek series. my first stop off was TNG as it was the one I was most interested in and I've got the box sets of TOS and Enterprise to get to later.

But right now I'm working through voyager and my thoughts;

\-I agree with most that it's certainly one of the weaker series, I think SF debris called it TNG in a new coat of paint and I'm inclined to agree. Though I'd say there are far more enjoyable episodes after season 3.

\-Surprisingly I seem to be at odds with many people about Kes, the show greatly improved with her leaving. Her actress gave a very soft breathy performance and with her telepathic power she was just another Troi only even less important. Her species as well is one of the worst designed for a main character. The only problem with her leaving was that they never seemed to think about replacing her with another nurse, not even a non-speaking one.

\-I think this one is really gonna get me some hate, but I'm actually enjoying Neelix. At least beyond season 3, and even then you can see any Arc there from a bumbling conman with a childish temperament to an actually helpful character.

\-While overdone sometimes, Tuvok is not a bad vulcan, I've seen worse ones in TNG (and I've heard I'll run into many more bad ones in enterprise)

\-I do agree with many of the community that the Doctor and Seven are some of the highlights of the entire show. Though halfway through season 5 I'm already getting repeated stories for seven. And it is a bit annoying when you have you tell people the large titted woman in a tight uniform is one of the better characters and have to wait and see how they take that.

\-The magical repairing ship and the near limitless supply of shuttlecraft is probably one of the biggest weaknesses once you notice it, because once you do, it just can't be ignored.

\-Kazon? bad copy of a klingon

Viddian? Nice idea, almost like an organic version of the borg. But needed more than 3 episodes.

Those hunter aliens-forgot their names because they're less ""predator"" and more ""elmer fudd""

The Garbage scout aliens-a nice idea again, but buried with too few epsiodes and not enough interesting details.

Those are just a few of my thoughts. Will you tell me I'm doomed from this point on (again about mid season 5), or give me hope for that emmy award winning seventh season episode I've never heard of? ",0

"I'm watching Star Trek for the first time...So I watch tos about a year ago and loved it. I've now just finished tng and loved it even more! BUT now I'm on ds9, 7 episodes in and not really feeling it. It's as if I'm watching a soap opera. 

Should I skip it if I'm not digging it by now or does it get going in later seasons?

"startrek discoveryso this show came out a while back. it was on cbs for its pilot as i watched it on xfinity cable (or started to, i got a phone call and had to pause it). i went back to watch it later on demand but it was gone, no listing, no information, no show page on x1 on demand... just fucking gone. MONTHS went by before i finally found out it seems to not be aired on ANY cable network but is rather online only, who the fuck thought this was a good idea?

so after pirating the show as ill be damned if im going to pay for a show that is on a network i PAY over 200.00 a month to have on xfinity... i am trying to get used to a few things, not bad so far but i would say the show panders too much for my taste. i do not enjoy any show/movie that feels the need to talk its way though every aspect of what is hapening on the screen and it seems thus far anyway, that startrek does this. im only 2 episodes in however so im holding off on final judgments.

however the real reason i came on here was to ask a question, a question about previews. at the end of the 2nd episode there is a 6 minute section that is only marked as separate from the episode in a passing remark about 'still to come in startrek' and then it goes into a reveal of all the fucking plot points in the season? am i just weird or do others despise this type of shit too? I feel angry when someone spoils an ending or give away a plot point and yet all over the movies and tv there seems to be this trend to showing all of the best parts, spoiling all the reveals, and just deflating all the air out of the scripts before they are released?

just a rant from what ive noticed so far

tl;dr  fuck previews

i also do not understand the story arc that some how michael started all this... she is blamed by her captian, starfleet, and the people on the transport she is on in ep3. so she goes to investigate an artifact, while there gets attacked by a klingon and wins, then she tries to attack them but is not allowed to. from how i see it she is only guilty of staying alive. its starfleets policy to not shoot first that is what allowed the war to proceed and it is the klingons fault there is war.  now at the end she goes to the klingon ship to capture the fucking guy and then kills him? i dont get that, seems lazy writing to me. in either case its her fault he may be a maryter now but the war was already started by that point.   

tl;dr, imo everyone yelling she caused the war are spouting bull shit and the writers in no way have explained this line of thought",0

"When and by whom should dress uniforms be worn?I just got word that a friend has set her wedding date as 'May the Fourth' (no coincidence) and, since she and the groom are both Trek fans as well, I asked if I'd still be allowed to show up in dress uniform. I was kidding but she approved in earnest, and now I'm considering it. Just one, silly question:

I can't seem to glean a consistent pattern of usage from the episodes in which dress uniforms are worn. In the wedding scenes, its wear ranges from no one (TOS's ""Balance of Terror"") to only those officiating or part of ""wedding party"" in dress uniform (TNG's ""Data's Day"" and VOY's ""Course: Oblivion"") to all Starfleet personnel in attendance (""Nemesis""). Other scenes are equally mystifying, as it doesn't seem to ever be worn by everyone at a given occasion. I realize this is far less important than the bride and groom's approval, but now that I'm thinking about it I'd be curious if anyone else can shed light on the subject (based on Naval regulations or otherwise).",0

"I think it makes sense that humans are the forefront of the federationOutside of production/filming reasons, I think it makes sense that we often see humans leading the federation. Humanity is what united all these races together, we often see races in Star Trek befriend humans and then subsequently becoming more like us.

Nog for example hung around with Jake Sisko and ended up becoming a Star Fleet officer.

It's also canonical that humans are kind of seen as the leaders of the federation. We often see other races mention Humans first and foremost when talking about the federation.

It is because of humanities desire to be social/friendly with other races that organisations such as the federation are formed. All the other major factions are formed by one species.

Moral of the story: Humans rule aliens drool.",0
"TNG Discussion: Picard and the BorgIn I, Borg, Picard decides to send a virus that give the Borg free will. While most of us may find Picard's actions right to some extent, when did he stop doing the right thing? Should Crusher have never helped Hugh? Should they have let the Borg purge Hugh's memory? Should they have implanted the virus to kill off the Borg?

Personally I think Crusher did the right thing, but they had no right to give the other Borg free will. Hugh could've resisted their beliefs at any moment, but he **chose** not to. The other Borg were never given that choice which goes against their free will? collective will? Regardless, it goes against not only the Prime Directive, it takes away what it was trying to give.

"What was the viewer reaction to Dax’s death and return when DS9 season 6 ended and 7.01 aired?I’ve been a big fan of Deep Space Nine for years but by the time I started watching, the show was well past its original production and run. I recently have been going through a rewatch of the show (always a great choice) and finished season 7 episode 1 “Image in the Sand”. I realized that Ezri’s appearance was placed at the end of the episode, which must have intended to be a huge reveal by the writers to the live audience viewing the episode for the first time. For those of you who saw the show when it was airing live for the first time - what was the audience and community reaction when Ezri’s character was revealed, and Jadzia is killed by Dukat? For those of us who watch via. streaming services - the effect is lost a bit as the episodes are back to back. ",0

"Differences in Special Features on TNG Blue Ray Box Set vs Individual Seasons and special releasesI recently saw that the Best Of Both Worlds Blue Ray release included a special documentary called Regeneration: Engaging the Borg. I had just started checking out some of the special features on the series set and I figured, ""Hey, that sounds cool. I can watch it on the special features on my TNG Series box blue ray set.""

Well, much to my dismay it isn't included. From a few a Youtube searches it looks like there are other special features that were included in the individual season blue ray discs but not on the box set. UGH. Very frustrating. I really want to watch all of the extras but the thought of purchasing all the individual season discs to placate CBS' money grab isn't exactly something i want to do. I can't seem to locate a list of the missing features or difference in features between the releases. Does any know what they are or just somewhere it's available?

"A possibly way to save the Kelvin Timeline moviesWith the recent paycut debacle involving Chris Pine and Chris Hemsworth, the future of the Kelvin Timeline films is in jeopardy. Now I know a ton of Trek fans hate those films, but I'm one of the few Trek fans who seem to really like them. They recaptured elements of TOS but mixed in with big screen action. They weren't perfect, but I've enjoyed them and I don't think the Kelvin francise deserves to die. So I have thought of a way to save it (possibly). So here's my idea:

Focus on a new starship and crew. I mean, come on, Kirk and the Enterprise crew can't be the only ones who have had amazing adventures. A new captain and crew on a different ship set at the same time as Chris Pine's Kirk adventures could be a smart move and a chance to start fresh. Maybe Pine or Quinto could be persuaded to appear in a cameo at the beginning or something.

They don't need to follow the adventures of The Enterprise. Look at what they did with Discovery, different ship, different captain, different crew. The Kelvin Timeline needs to learn from Discovery and follow suit.

I would follow the adventures of Matt Decker in the Kelvin Timeline, and I'd cast Mark Ruffalo or Henry Rollins as I feel both those guys would bring something interesting to the role. My idea is that in the Kelvin Timeline, Decker and his crew never encounter the doomsday machine (or it plays out totally different and Decker doesn't lose his crew and go insane) and they continue to have many more adventures on the USS Constellation.

It could also be set around or a little before the events of Star Trek 2009, maybe Bruce Greenwood could reprise his version of Pike briefly. Maybe get JJ Abrams to return in the director's chair, and maybe hire some better writers who can come up with a new Trek script that'll really grab audiences. I think this could be the shot in the arm that the Kelvin films need.",0

"Yesterday I finished DS9 after watching for a year. Please mourn with me.Preface: Dad was a big Trek fan when I was growing up. I was old enough (8 years old) to remember watching the TNG series finale with him. I watched some DS9 then too but overall I wasn't a fan of Trek because I was a child and couldn't understand the storylines. I watched Voyager with him regularly as a teenager. So I watched the Abrams Star Trek movies and got nostalgic for the times I bonded with my dad watching Trek and wanted to take the voyage myself. Found I loved Trek. Watched TOS, then TNG, then DS9. 

It took me a year or so to get through DS9. I liked almost every episode (only ep I truly hate was the one where they're stuck inside the game on season 1), I liked every character. I can't believe how much its series finale is impacting me. Yesterday I hummed the shows theme song at work all day. Just thinking about the ending makes me cry. I can't believe it's over. I can't believe the characters are gone and I'll never be caught up in their lives anymore.

I have a few problems with the finale. Namely, I feel that Damar deserved to live. He should have lived and gave a broadcast to both Cardassia and Bajor to finally build a bridge between their two worlds. To officially seal the end of the old Cardassia (literally) and the birth of a new one. But they killed him and no speech was had. Just Cardassia and its ashes. It's utterly depressing and it amazes me how given how much the show harped on the relationship between the two planets, they neglected to take advantage of showing a bridge between the two nations, in earnest, at last. It's a baffling creative decision and leaves me wanting. Instead, they decided to make a scene at Vic's. 

Besides that, and the fact that Ezri and Julian feels tacked on and forced, I thought the ending was about as good as it could get. 

Right now I'm mourning that I'll never see the characters I love again. Kira, with her strong headed badassery, and her soft spirituality. She may very well be my favorite Star Trek character but I'm still deciding. The woman who was able to let go of her hate for Caradassians and work to help free them. The ending shot of her and Jake looking longingly for Sisko's return broke my heart, but what made me most emotional was Worf. Worf was always my favorite Star Trek character even as far back as when I was a kid. Besides Kira, no other character resonates with me as much as him and he really shined in DS9. So the final shot of him leaving the station looking at the promenade made me cry so hard because I knew it'd be the last time I'd ever seen Worf in Trek and I was forced to say goodbye to someone I've known since I was a child.

I can't believe I'm mourning someone that isn't even real. 

I can't believe it's over. Someone hold me.",0

"Underwhelmed by EaglemossNot sure if this is the right forum to discuss this, but is anyone else underwhelmed or even disappointed with the quality of Eaglemoss’s offerings? 

My first purchase was Defiant, and while it wasn’t as accurate as I could hope it was decent for a $22 toy. I picked up a Steamrunner that was okay, but the nacelles have embedded blue plastic rather than the fully enclosed nacelles I saw in First Contact. 

I gave it one last shot with the Sovereign, especially since so many people online have raved about it. What a letdown. It appears to be the First Contact variant with its extremely light colored finish, but the detailing is absolute rubbish, and some details that should be visible just aren’t there. 

I looked at the XL line but reviews and pictures made me change my mind. The XL Defiant has inaccurate nacelles, the XL Sovereign either has misaligned painted details or just blank hull, and the XL Galaxy looks rubbish to me. 

I think Eaglemoss’s level of detail is okay for very small ships like Defiant and probably the shuttles, but they lack the definition to replicate the bigger ships with any clarity. Out of three purchases, I’m 70% satisfied with one and dissatisfied with the others. 

I would venture though that TOS ships, with their lack of detailing and simpler shapes, would turn out better than TNG/DS9/VOY/Movie ships. ",0

"Just rewatched Day of Honor (Voy S4E3) and unless I'm missing something, the writers forgot to address one small detail. They never got their warp core back!They eject the core, the Caatati steal it, they ambush Voyager and say that they have their warp core, Seven makes the device to replicate Thorium, they say 'thanks,' and then they leave.  No one mentions the warp core ever again.  Sure, we can safely assume it was returned but given it was the central problem of the episode, I'd think they'd have addressed it.",0
"Please check the historical accuracy of my vague recollection of the Kirk films?I've been thinking about running a Star Trek RPG soon, and about the Treaty of Algeron (forbidding the Federation from developing cloak technology), and about the premise of a continuous narrative chain through The Wrath Of Khan, The Search For Spock, The Voyage Home, and The Undiscovered Country (skipping ST5 entirely).

My best recollection is as follows: in TSFs, Kruge was aware of preliminary diplomatic talks between the Klingon and Federation governments, well before the Praxis disaster. And similarly, in TUC, the Romulan Ambassador was present at the Khitomer conference for reasons not made clear in the film itself. 

My understanding is that, since everything else in TSFS flows directly from the aftermath of the Genesis debacle, it follows that the diplomatic efforts Kruge referenced do as well. The Genesis device soon proved to be an utter failure as a terraforming system, but its applicability as a planet-killing weapon was instantly obvious to everyone involved. 

So my conclusion is that the Treaty of Algeron isnt so much that the Romulans can have cloaking technology but the Federation can't; rather that nobody can be allowed to have both the capacity to create a Genesis device and the capacity to deploy it under cloak to an enemy world. Each of the political powers on the galactic stage can have one or the other, but if anybody tries to have both, then everyone else unites to obliterate them. 

Seen in this not-necessarily-canon light, the Romulan Commander Taris in TNG: Contagion, insisting that the Federation could not be allowed to gain control of Iconian Gateway technology... starts to look a lot less villainously nationalistic. 

So, anybody spot any flaws in my recollection?",0

"[TNG] Does it get better than the bad first impression?Only caught the random DS9 and Voyager mostly back as a kid, but I heard that TNG was even better.

So I saw the first two episodes. Farpoint was good, if a bit quirky and slow-paced.

But, S1E2, The Naked Now, has really put me off.

I'll forgive the one-dimensional 'everyone gets drunk and now almost everyone just wants to screw each other.' Only a handful actually do *other* drunk things. It's dumb but fine. Must be a lot of tension being stuck on a ship forever, even if it was shown in the pilot the enterprise is actually pretty big. Maybe Starfleet don't allow crew to have formal relationships?

I had also expected Wesley to be a problem, it's a bit of a meme. But this trope of 'bumbling idiot endangers the cast and gets rewarded' really gets to me.

Wesley, a child civilian, starts a mutiny, assumes command of Engineering, couldn't care less the ship was being taken apart right next to him, and finally, instead of being thrown in the brig as a timeout, he's *rewarded* for buying a few extra seconds for someone else to fix his problem?

Please tell me that this isn't a common occurrence. Or at least a list of the episodes where that trope exists, so I can avoid them like the plague.

"All the hate for BFII aside - I REALLY enjoyed....the conversations between Del Meeko and Luke Skywalker. That is some proper world building and character arcs right there. It was amazing to hear the Empire's perspective on who the Jedi were and watch those lies getting teared down one kind act after another. 

It gave me goosebumps and I will definitely cherish that one mission as one of my favourites.  

Also shoutout to the dialogue between the characters. 

Shriv Suurgav for example was an exceptional character and I loved the chemistry between him and essentially anyone. The banter between him and Calrissian on Sullust was hilarious and truly on point - the chemistry between Shriv and both Iden gals' was amazing as well.  

I really enjoyed listening to Meeko and Iden as they approached the Cloud City in their TXs as well. Their banter about Cloud cars and then forced to use it to complete their mission was gold too.

-

I get it that this game gets a lot of heat and the criticism is warranted, definitely. I thought the campaign was genuinely good however, albeit a bit repetitive perhaps, but I enjoyed it through and through and just want to mention that.

Especially the general world building and Resurrection campaign. It was really cool to see how they merged the campaign with the movies with Zay and Shriv delivering the Dreadnought blueprints and then leaving MOMENTS before *The Last Jedi* begins.

"Why Reylo won’t happenThat ship has sailed. 

Rey literally closes the door on Kylo at the end of TLJ. 

They are still connected (no, Snokes not alive) as we see in this ending scene. Rey and Kylo are looking at each other and Rey closes the door. This is literal and figurative. 

That doesn’t mean Kylo won’t redeem himself, but his redemption will be different than others. 

Rose says you win by saving those you love. Love is obviously a theme in Star Wars and a motif for the Force (light side). We already know Kylo still cares about if not loves his mother as he couldn’t bring himself to kill her. This will be what saves him. I think she’ll die and that will bring him back somehow. 

I’m not saying he’s going to join the resistance or be a hero but he’ll be saved from the dark side. 

I think he’ll follow in Luke’s footsteps and exile himself, block himself off from the Force. He’ll learn the truth about Vader (Anakin), how he was redeemed. 

We’ll get an ending shot of Ben Solo, alone on Tatooine with the two suns in the distance. Maybe Force ghost Luke and Anakin with him. ",1

"Fan Theory: Death Troopers are old clone ARC troopers who stayed on with the EmpireSo I was rewatching season 6 last night and noticed 5's armor additions looked enough like Krenic's guards for me to come up with this.

What if they're called Death troopers(here by referred to as DTs) not as a name to bestow terror but as a catagorization. As clone were created with rapid growth most DT would be close to death.

It also stands (to me at least) that the TIE Reaper is similar in a sense to the LAAT Gunship. There are similarities in the designs such as the general shape of the body and swoop of the wings.

Reaper and Death are terms I would use to describe something both old and menacing. 

I also am under the impression that DTs are modify soldiers. And it would make sense that clone were subject to it as they are already genetically modified. 

In one of the Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith comics he goes about fighting clone (before he makes his red lightsaber) and I recall the clones talking about needing to find a way to be useful again.

Now I know in Rebels we heard DTs talk without the heavy modulation but voices can be re dubbed ( ala special editions) so I dont think that's a strong enough case for not.

It's just a theory.",1

But it’s fun to consider that R2 would absolutely recognize Yoda from all the years that spent around each other. It’s even possible that Yoda would recognize R2. So when R2 is fighting Yoda for the flashlight, he’s just playing along with the act to fool Luke. Very wise of the little droid to let things play out the way they did. ",1
"Was there ever an explanation why noone noticed for 10 years the production of the GAR and especially the equipment?Like the title already says.

That’s a question going through my head for a while now. How was the republic unable to notice the GAR production?

If we start with the equipment. That are numbers, I cannot even imagine. The largest producers of the galaxy received orders to produce hundreds of venators, thousands of cruisers, probably hundred of thousand fighters.

The GAR itself required enormous amount on food. Kamino was deleted from the databases but somehow I don’t believe they grew food for all the clones on kamino.

Even if split up onto different companies and in a galaxy as large as Star Wars. those are numbers where **every** intelligence service should get panic.

How many clones did the GAR include? 100 Million? 50?

In the movie they say, „with a million more **units** on the way“. Obviously 1 unit can’t be 1 clone and must refer to a larger group.

I knew that a couple of years ago no official numbers were stated.

Did that changed? Or are there any ""fan made“ numbers?",1

"My headcanon theory on the Nebulon B frigateAfter seeing the scene from Rebels where the old Y-Wings appear, I had an inspiration. (I did a search on this subreddit first, and didn't see anything obvious, so my apologies if this is a recurrence.)

What if the Nebulon B's we see the rebels using in Episode 6 and elsewhere are severely stripped down? It's often been observed that the thin spine of the Nebulon B frigate seems like a glaring weak spot. What if the Nebulon B is really just the ""spine"" of a modular warship system? Maybe weapon and hangar modules are supposed to go around the spine and behind the ""hatchet"" section? Maybe the plating seen on the sides of the ""hatchet"" section are the remnants of armor plating which has been stripped away? Perhaps some Nebulon B's owned by the Empire were stripped down, decommissioned, then sold to civilians? The rebels would still want to get their hands on a ship with over-built military grade navigation and power systems. As with the Y-Wings, perhaps the greater speed and maneuverability of the  stripped-down configuration actually suited the rebel's hit and run tactics even better? (Especially if they could be refitted with those sweet Mon Calamari high tech shield generators.)",1

"Padme and Galactic ConflictsI do not know if it would have mattered or not, but it seems to me that Padme was  the catalyst for causing the Palpatines acension into the chancellorship and the indirect cause of the clone wars and said escalation. If we look we see that it was her proposal for a vote of no confidence that elevated palpatine. Her quest for a peace also allowed for an escalation during the Separatist Crisis as her attempted assassination due to her vocal opinions on the mattee that led to the Jedi discovering the clone army which then allowed the republic to further militarize. And do not forget during the Clone Wars in which she attempted to open peace talks with Mina Bonteri the discovery of which led to Bonteri's death at the hand of Dooku's henchmen which crushed any attempt for peace and made things worse. It was also her loyalist committee and petition of systems to the chancellor which allowed the seeds of rebellion to sowed in the waning days of the republic. 

I just feel like had Padme not been such a pacifist or selfish about her people and had thought about the larger ramifications of what she was doing maybe things would not have progressed so quickly as they did or escalated to such levels. I may be reaching and grasping at air but i would like to get your opinions on this. I think it adds a different view of how everything transpired in the movies and stat wars universe.",1
"What do people mean when they say Legends has a complicated and hard to follow timeline?This one majorly confuses me. For starters at the front of every novel is a nice two page spread that has the timeline of books from back in the Old Republic era all the way to Fate. And if its a newer reprint of the book it will even have a updated timeline of the books. So you just have to look at that timeline to see where the book falls in the Star Wars universe. Just like you do in the new books. 

Same for the comics (in fact that comics in Legends are a bit more specific about the date than the NEU is) which has a nice timeline starting all the way back in the old Dark Horse stuff showing you where it goes. 

Plus now we have something that I didn't have untill HS which is wookieepedia and its nice timeline of both legends and canon books and comics that people can look at. 

So how it that a complicated or hard to follow timeline?

If people are saying this when they really just mean that their are to many books for them to read then they better already be caught up to the NEU books because their are already about 30 novels not counting some things like Join the Resistance. 

Or do they mean its confusing going into a series and accidentally picking up the second book and reading it first? Becuase I have done that despite it saying ""Book 2 of the Black Fleet Crisis"" on front of my copy of Shield of Lies",1

"Rex &amp; Wolffe's helmets changed from CW to Rebels? Any canon reason for this?[Comparison pictures](https://i.imgur.com/XPIsqO6.jpg)

I noticed that Rex's and Wolffe's helmets are different in Rebels &amp; Clone Wars. In CW, they appear to have very different helmets, Wolffe's looking like a modified BARC Trooper, while Rex's is a modified Phase 2 helmet with a Phase 1 visor &amp; totally unique mouthpiece. However, in rebels they look far more similar to eachother, instead looking much closer to Phase 2 helmets; Both of them having the same Phase 2 mouthpieces (despite completely different in CW) and Wolffe completely losing the smooth helmet front his CW counterpart had &amp; shared with BARC troopers.

I get that Rebels has an overall more accurate aesthetic to the movies when it comes to armour (e.g. the Phase 1 helmet looking practically identical to that seen in AOTC), but this can't be due to the aesthetic change from CW to Rebels, because we already saw Phase 2 troopers in CW and we could see how different Rex &amp; Wolffe looked to them.

I was wondering if there's any canon reason for this, or if anybody knows if I'm completely mistaken. These are the kind of nitpicky things that bug me, so I'd love to be directed to some piece of canon that explains the change, or to be completely proven wrong! :D",1

When Rose's sister falls to the base platform of the bomber, losing the remote for the release of the bombs. What if...  
  
She kicks the metal framework once, twice, the remote seems it's falling down to her hand but, instead of conveniently falling into her grasps it just sits there, out of reach.  
She reaches for her medallion with her left hand, the right one toward the remote. She starts chanting:  
  
""I am one with the Force. The Force is with me.  
I am one with the Force, the Force is with me.""  
  
The remote starts shaking. Her eyes widens. She can't believe it's working and keeps going.  
  
""I am one with the Force, the Force is with me!""  
  
The remote tilts over the ledge and falls to her hand.  
She presses the button.  
The rest unfolds as we know.  
  
I think this would reinforce the tone of the ""Force being again into everybody"" from the get go, and it would raise some questions about the Force as a cult, with the chant Chirrut was repeating to himself in Rogue One.

"How I would fix the First OrderAt the moment we have no idea how the First Order came to be, who Snoke was and what their intentions really are. For my own sanity watching the sequels, this is how I would fix some of the bigger holes. 

So to begin.... The First Order was not always an army. It began as an organisation which specialised in healing or repairing dying planets. This organisation was created and run by Snoke, who being force sensitive, has similar gifts as Anakin Skywalker in terms of building/creating technology. 
The labour force behind Snokes “planet repair” company would be child slaves, like Finn, taken and brainwashed to perform manual labour. Although the Galaxy would not agree with this method, they overlook it because Snoke is saving the homes of billions of species. (and as we know from TLJ, there’s a lot of child slave labour in the Galaxy).

Snoke, although incredibly force sensitive, doesn’t really know what the force is. That is until he meets Ben Solo, who now hates the Jedi, and tells Snoke all about the dark side and the Old Empire. Snoke already has immense wealth and power from his organisation and now that Ben has romanticised the dark side, he starts to crave more. Together they begin to turn the labour force into an army to emulate the old empire. 
Snoke uses his existing planet repair technology to turn a dead, unused planet into Star Killer base where they recruit Hux to oversee the conversion of slaves from labour to army. 

As this army is new and hasn’t really done anything to consider itself a threat to the republic so they have no real opposition. 
Leia senses the dark side building so hurriedly puts together a rebel alliance. She can’t get that many allies as no one is really convinced that the First Order is anything to worry about. 

This, to me, would explain how the First Order is so rich but so disorganised and clumsy. It would also explain why they’re so similar to the Old Empire and why there’s such a small rebel army. 

Anyway, that’s just the back story I created to be able to enjoy the sequels. It doesn’t fill every hole, but a few of the main ones. I’d be interested to know how you would fix it, or if you even think it needs fixing.

"Theory: Ben ""Lies""One of the repeating patterns in Star Wars could easily be that a character named ""Ben"" will lie about the protagonist's parentage. 

Kylo Ren AKA ""Ben Solo"" is most likely somewhat lying about Rey's parentage. Later, he'll probably say something along the lines of ""it's true from a certain point of view"". 

If Disney intends to reveal a twist in episode 9 , then it would make sense to mislead the audience beforehand in order to help that twist register with a majority of the audience. 

In a lot of ways, The Last Jedi was a red herring for what is to come. Rian Johnson knew he would most likely be hated by many of the fans because he was kinda hired to do that exact thing and it clearly influenced his decision making during the making of TLJ. ",1
"If Sequel Trilogy was done in the style of the MCU Here is my hypothetical pitch for the Sequel Trilogy done under a Feige, long plan, MCU style.  Instead of Avengers, there will be “Episodes” 7, 8, and 9, with other smaller focused films that tie into the Episodes, which will be called “Stand Alones.”  This is meant to be a fun thought experiment and not meant to criticize the franchise in anyway.  This was inspired by the San Diego Sabers Podcast about Star Wars and the MCU.

**Stand Alone #1** **- Finn and the First Order** \- Finn origin story that coincides with character development for Hux, Phasma, and the other troopers.  Genre - psychological thriller based on Finn slowly discovering the “dark side” behind the First Order.  End Credit - Kylo Ren and Snoke introduced

**Stand Alone #2 - Poe and the Rebellion** \- Poe origin story that coincides with galactic politics and the rising threat of the First Order.  Audience is updated to Leia and Han’s current situation. Genre - Action packed battles and high stakes politics. End Credit #1 - Rey End Credit #2 - Luke.

**Episode 7 - Force Awakens** \- This would follow much of the Force Awakens, with the exception that it ends with horrific genocide and destruction from the First Order (who is still finalizing Star Killer Base). Genre - Classic Star Wars. End Credit - Rey hears Luke’s voice.

**Stand Alone #3 - Rey** \- This would be Rey’s quest to find Luke.  She would start with friends but due to threats from the first order and other fun evil dangers, she would have to face the worst perils alone on her quest to find Luke.  She gets to Luke and begins her training. Genre - Buddy Quest/Mythic Quest. End Credit - Snoke’s plans/or origins.

**Stand Alone #4 - Kylo** \- This would be a mix of Kylo’s current struggles with identity and meaning along with flashbacks of his training and falling out with Luke. Daddy and Mommy issues galore. Genre - Suspense and Paranoia. End Credit - Ahsoka.

**Episode 8 - Last Jedi** \- Rey is almost done with her training, but force skypes with Kylo so rushes to go turn him to the light.  Finn and the Rebels, including Rose start to win some small battles and plan on destroying the StarKiller Base.  They face some betrayal from allies/spies etc.  Rey ends up defeating Kylo, Snoke is dead, and Rey and the rebels destroy Starkiller Base. Genre - Star Wars End Credit - Ahsoka.

**Stand Alone #5 - Finn and Rose** \- They need to get some information or spy or hacker or whatever, and go on a mission to a Coruscant and Canto Byte to get what they need.  All the while, Rose goes off on social inequality and injustice and Finn slowly learns to agree with her and fall in love.  They also discover other force sensitives who like clean floors. Genre - Romance. End Credit - Outer Regions.

**Stand Alone #6 - Rey and Poe** \- They both have different visions of finishing off the First Order - they both have pros and cons.  They both struggle to be a leader without trying to take the full responsibility of the Rebellion.  The Rebellion is stronger and seems to have the First Order Running, but they struggle with Snoke’s previously laid traps, manipulations, and scheming that keeps setting them back. Genre - Buddy / Action. End Credit - Kylo is losing his shit trying to run the First Order.

**Episode 8** \- Snoke had a heretofore unknown alien warlike civilization from the Outer Regions or another galaxy or something on the backburner this whole time and Kylo discovers them and shit goes down for the Rebellion.  Rey begs Luke, he refuses to help, she discovers Ahsoka, they fight hard and win - killing Kylo - with the help of Luke’s Force Projection who taunts Kylo like a mean uncle.  Luke becomes one with the force.  Genre - Star Wars. End Credit #1 - Finn and Rose get married and adopt broom boy. End Credit #2 - Poe becomes leader of the new Senate or Space Force or something. End Credit #3 - Rey and Ahsoka create a new Grayish Jedi Temple that is Sith Friendly.

**Network Television Show Throughout -** **Agents of the Rebellion** \- Starring Carrie Fisher’s Daughter, BB8, Ackbar, and other sundry rebels.

**Netflix Shows:**

**Cantobyte** \- Gangster Genre with bounty hunters, crime lords, and war profiteers. 

**Droids** \- A.I. Thriller on a planet struggling to stay neutral in the current star war.

**Force Sensitives** \- A small planet in the outer regions has a connection to the force, and the inhabitants are starting to discover amazing powers that disrupt their current way of life and cause fear in those who don’t have the powers (ala X-Men).

**Stars and Struggles** \- Bring all three Netflix shows together in one complicated trade/runaway/betrayal story.

"An interesting thought I had while rewatching the prequels that I haven't seen many people discuss before.Much of the prequel movies feel like I'm watching a live play rather than a movie. The dialogue is more regal in the prequels and the acting feels like something you'd see in a play rather than a film. This was a deliberate choice by George (in the BTS docs of the prequels he often says how galaxy at the time of the prequel-era was more Shakespearean) but his awkward scripts and the sometimes weak chemistry between actors really reinforce this, so in a weird way, George's weaknesses helped him achieve his goal.

Even the way the movies are shot feels very thespian, especially during talking scenes. The cameras are almost always stationary and never move around exploring the sets, and the variety of camera shots George uses is quite limited. I guess most of the sets being on a green-screen really limited how creative George could get with his camera angles and movements, turning locations into simple backdrops for the actors to perform against, just like a set in a play.

Anyone else ever noticed this? The talking scenes definitely feel like something you see in a theatre and there could be a live audience just behind the camera.",1
"Be honest: If Rey doesnt fail in the next movie, or fall to the Dark side (some may not consider this a fail), then she absolutly was a very bland character with no story arcWhen in the next movie she just fights Kylo, defeats him, and then the Rebels win - The End. Then what was her point?

"The jedi text on Ach-toDarth Sidious and Anakin killed all the Jedi. During that time someone, presumably a Jedi who was being hunted during an intergalactic war sought out this temple on Ach-to so that they could jot down the events of the PT and put Palpatine's real name in a book so that no one would find said books because all the Jedi are dead?

Would these books have even been something the PT Jedi didn't even know about because if they did, do you really think they would of the left the books there and not archive them or something like that? but no, this planet that Luke had to search for and hunt down somehow modern information on it?

That would be like someone finding the lost city of El Dorado and they find a book that talks about 9/11 and the events of war on terrorism and we use that information to dismantle our government since the book shows the Jedi order in a bad light, it must be bad or maybe the books were written by someone who saw the Jedi in a bad way and wanted to make them look bad. For all, we know Vader wrote those books.

Now this angle, we don't know what was in the text or who wrote. If they shed negative light on the Jedi made it written by someone who didn't like the Jedi. For all we know maybe Vader wrote them and wanted anyone who the found the temple to be dissuade into restarting the order, but then why not destroy the temple and the text?   


Also these are terrible plot device, in EP9 I feel that can be used in any manner to change anything about the Jedi. ""The book says this, lets do what the book says""   
 type of thing. personally i don't find a plausible reason that the information of the PT events along with the Alternative name of the Emperor would be stored in a book. If anyone wants have a CIVIL conversation about please respond, i'm down to have a conversation about it. :D",1

"Finn storyline [SPOILERS]Finn in TFA and TLJ was in my opinion, a wasted oppurtunity. Finn has such an intriguing backstory and something that we've never seen in Star Wars a bad guy that left the First Order and doesn't want to join the good guys.

In both films Finn repeatedly says that he doesn't want to join the rebellion but ends up joining amyways why he does this idk. Also Finn seems to be a little psychotic, in TFA it is revealed the first order storm troopers are brain washed and not truly evil, but shortly after Finn returns from the massacre he instantly starts to murder his well... practically his brothers and he seems to be utterly remorseless it would have been cool in my opinion if he didn't join the rebellion and would try and rescue other storms troopers.

That's my thoughts on Finn, also it is kind of sad now that I think about it when the resistance kills storm troopers now because they are all brainwashed what do you guys think?",1

"Why I don't believe the ST ""undoes"" the OT.We often see this criticism of the ST.  ""All of the victories of the OT are now meaningless because there's a new Empire that's controlling everything.""  Well, that's simply not true.

In TFA, the First Order is a new Imperial regime, but they're not controlling everything.  They successfully plunged the galaxy into a chaotic state by atomizing the New Republic's capital system, but they're not the dominant regime at the beginning of the film.  And in TLJ, they are in the process of conquering the galaxy, but their ability to actually RULE the galaxy is called into question because they have a lunatic who is running the show now (Kylo Ren), and they have to deal with a galaxy that is ready to fight back (because of Luke's heroic sacrifice).  So they aren't going to be sitting in power for decades like the Empire did.

The way I see it, in the end, the ST will be about how the galaxy ALMOST descended back into tyrannical rule, but it was prevented because new heroes -- heroes who were inspired by the OT heroes -- rose up and protected what the OT heroes fought for.  And the OT heroes were there to help them along the way.",1

"Underrated Scene: Why I now understand and respect the death of Luke SkywalkerSimple quick post of me wanting to share.. This may or may not have already been posted or talked about, but after having several roller coaster emotions about the death of Luke Skywalker, I caught one scene in the Last Jedi that finally has me a peace.

During one of the scenes where Kylo and Rey are having their ""connection"" interactions, Kylo says to Rey, ""You will bring Luke Skywalker to me.. (confused look) You're not doing this.. the effort would kill you"".

From my vantage point, this a nod towards the end where Luke does his whole hologram scene and eventually.. spoiler alert.. passes away into the force.

Maybe I am wrong, but for now it makes sense. I keep picking up on more and more of TLJ and more in favor of than have ever been before. However the bomb ""open door"" scene and Leia opening the door to space still have my brain in a flux.

Thanks for reading and may the force be with you..",1

"I really don't like the Bloodline novel, and here's why.I've repeatedly expressed my opinion of it on SW discord, but it's tiresome to write down my arguments every time, so I'll keep it in one place here.

Bloodline is Claudia Grey's novel focusing on Princess Leia and her decision to form the Resistance. On paper it sounds like a solid premise, and Claudia's Lost Stars book is deservingly praised as one of the best books in new canon, despite (or maybe because of) being a young adult novel. So what could go wrong? Well, in part it's my subjective perception of course, and some I feel is a bit of mishandling of central premise. Let's take a closer look at it.

Ah, right. Spoiler warning for Bloodline. I'll leave it unmarked, since it's been a long time since the book came out and I don't want to have the rest of the post blanked out.

The central conflict in Bloodline is a split in New Republic senate. One faction of Centrists want to institute a Chancellor in the senate with power to break ties and get shit done, as well as keeping the military fleet, while other faction of Populists, to which Princess Leia belongs, want to decentralize the New Republic and ultimately had their sights on disbanding the fleet.

To put it mildly, I disagree with Leia's faction position here. The plot itself is kicked off by Ryloth requesting assistance and investigation from the Senate, because twi'leks get raided by the pirates, and Ryloth position is pretty much exactly example of what Populist faction wanted to implement - mostly self-governed world, looking out for itself with ties to galactic society. And, well, now it needs protection from the Senate and New Republic Fleet, because they're getting raided. This position, if taken to the extreme, is essentially tantamount to breaking up the Republic into confederacy with every planet-state pulling the blanket to itself. Quite frankly, it's medieval way of governing things, just waiting for an Empire to pick systems one by one. And considering that Senate *already* can't agree on anything, getting the senate to coordinate this mess would flat out impossible.

It doesn't help that the position of Centrists - having a Head of State, or ""First Senator"" as they've put it, and keeping robust military is essentially mirrors the structure of New Republic in old Expanded Universe.

So that's one point, but it's not big enough to write a wall of text about, right? Right. Let's continue and see how these factions are portrayed.

The Populists are basically ineffectual. Their only position is ""We won't be like Empire"", and they stick to it to an absurd degree. In their mind having a chancellor with a tiebreaker vote is tantamount to setting up a new Emperor, just because Palpatine weaseled in getting more and more emergency powers. For this they're pretty much committed to just oppose Centrists regardless of what Centrists actually say, since from their point of view a Centrist senate = Empire.

And here comes my main issue with the book.

The Centrists are basically portrayed as the Empire. A token #notallcentrists secondary protagonist collects imperial memorabilia, admires the effective management. But then he comes to realize how many of his colleagues in the party are nostalgic for the Empire and basically think that maybe Palpatine wasn't such a bad chap. Oh, and by the way, the raids on Ryloth? A plot by Centrist sympathisers. Oh, and by the way - Centrists are infiltrated and manipulated by the First Order. So they're Literally The Empire.

The message of Leia being disenchanted in politics somewhat falls flat when it basically boils down to ""Look, our prejudice against Centrists is justified! They All Really Are Imperials!""

And what makes it personal to me, is that this treatment is given to the side that espoused most reasonable way of governing the galactic government and the way it worked in Legends continuity. That to be honest reads as an insult. What am I supposed to conclude from this? That being reasonable is equal to being an evil Imperial or preferring Legends is equal to being an evil Imperial?

I must admit, it's jarring to go from excellent Lost Stars to such a mess of a story in Bloodline. I'm hesitant to pick up Leia Princess of Alderaan now, because I don't know what kind of Claudia Grey is in there.

Now I've heard counter-arguments, sure. Like Populists just want to be like Old Republic... but well, they're not Old Republic, and Old Republic system proved it's flaws already by transforming into Empire. And they're living in a very different galaxy from the Old Republic too. The one where pirates get their hands on Super Star Destroyers. And of course there's subjective issue of being insulted, which won't go away with logic arguments.

So here we are. I don't like Bloodline. I think it's political conflict is mishandled, and since this conflict is major part of the book, it hurts the whole novel by extension.",1

Rey failed to help Ben. And Ben's failures... well he actually succeeded in getting rid of Snoke, and becoming his own master. At least on the surface it seems that he did better than the heroes. In reality, he is alone, and still a slave to his emotions.

In Episode IX, I am expecting a time skip. We will get to see how things in the galaxy are under Kylo Ren. 

Sadly, it will also be a galaxy without Leia. 

How the characters respond to these things, and to their own failures in The Last Jedi, is something I can not wait to see.

"I finally got around to watching The Last Jedi [Spoilers]Overall it wasn’t the best Star Wars movie, when Poe went up to The First Orders Star Destroyer and pulled a “hello can you here me?” Joke I knew this wasn’t going to be good. Star Wars in my opinion held a fine line on an Action/Drama with a sprinkle of comedy mixed into it, let’s say about a 60:30:10 ratio. When I watched something like The Last Jedi it felt more on the lines of a 40:20:40, I even compared it to something of trying to be a Marvel movie. They tried to add way to much story into the movie also, from the weird sea lizard in the background at Luke’s Island to the stuff like the ice cats how they just showed up and now they are just a thing.

The plot was hard to follow with I think 3 different stories all together? I was lost, especially during Finn and Roses scenes, they decided it would make sense that instead of going to the master code breaker to trust Benicio Del Toro because he was able to break out of a jail cell with a card. And then to use his character to bring in a “war is for money” thing which I didn’t care about. 

And one of the biggest complaints I had was Rose, before I start I am pro women I’m not one of those sexist people that doesn’t want women protagonists in my Star Wars. I just think that Rose was just kind of annoying, she was trying to do too much good to the point where you’d almost stop watching the movie. I feel like they could’ve done a better job with her character and she would’ve been much more lovable, but honestly I didn’t like her.

And to add the Leía Force Scene wasn’t as bad as I thought, still bad but wasn’t that bad.",1

"What I want from a Boba Fett movieJust my opinion based on liking the character. Not exactly thrilled with his character origins, but not disappointed either. I think that a Boba Fett movie would be awesome if it was done one of two ways.

1. Done like Dredd. It’s Boba Fett on a high value target... Possibly partnered with other Bounty Hunter(s). Post ROTS, pre ANH. Not a ton of locations. More of a showcase of his abilities tracking down a target, delivering, getting paid. Never removes helmet (possibly one shot where Daniel Logan puts on/takes off the helmet. Have Boba Fett played primarily by stuntmen. Not tied to any other films in any critical way. Just a small, self contained day in the life of Boba Fett during a challenging bounty. Violent, pushing the extremes of a PG-13 rating.

2. Post Return of the Jedi. Disoriented Fett escapes Sarlacc pit. Tracks Han back to Cloud city where Imperial holdouts are making one of their last stands. Tons of callbacks. Made about five years from now, uses Solo actors to reprise their roles with the Han and Lando scenes on Cloud City. Ties in heavily to Last Jedi. Boba Fett and Solo end up in a truce. Twist to the Boba Fett story is that we discover that Jango Fett had multiple clones of Boba Fett made, and they’re all active.",1

"A New Hope: What were the trench run wingmen supposed to be doing?I mean, I understand from a dramatic perspective that having guys picked off one by one adds to the tension, but was there ever a stated reason that three guys had to do the trench run together? Two just seem to sit there and do nothing but get picked off. 

I think one of them says something about ""holding off"" Vader and the two other TIEs, but quite how he was doing that escapes me. Unless they were being human shields, just there to physically block the Imperials from shooting the leader? 

Tactically, wouldn't it have made more sense to have the two wingmen out of the trench and ""higher"" (relative to the Death Star) than the leader, that way they could dive down and shoot at the back of any TIE trying to get onto the leader's six? 

Overthinking maybe, but I'm wondering if I missed an in-universe explanation for the tactic? ",1
"How did Palpatine force-choke Dooku from half a galaxy away?In the Clone Wars, when Palpatine became displeased with Count Dooku, he outright force choked him from half a galaxy away.

This is far, far beyond what any other Sith can do. Even Darth Vader could merely force choke someone on the same ship as him, and that was with a regular human.

If Palpatine was so powerful, what was stopping him from randomly getting into holograms with his enemies, then force choking them immediately?",1

"Rian Johnson subverted the expectations of mathematics.Holdo says there are 400 people left across three ships after Kylo's attack. These people eventually all get consolidated on the Raddus. There are 30 transports launched from the Raddus, and only 6 of them make it to Crait. Each transport can hold up to [60 passengers plus 3 crew spots] (https://i.imgur.com/c9Th7gM.jpg). So at most you would need 7 transports to evacuate every Resistance member on the Raddus.

The problem is two-fold: the first issue is fuel scarcity. Poe is alarmed when he sees that Holdo is fueling up the transports. There's a finite amount remaining and it's really weird to divide it 30 ways versus 7. Less transports equals less prep time, less fuel(or more fuel per transport) and less logistics. And then the second big issue is secrecy. If the great plan Holdo came up with is to sneak off the Raddus in plain sight of the Supremacy and merely hope they won't be paying attention, it seems far better and sneakier to use fewer transports. With 30 transports you are far more likely to be spotted. Forget ""stealth"" tech... did Holdo forget that these ion engines light up blue against space, like 30 fireflies heading to Crait?

So if we assume an equal distribution of Resistance members among the transports, it's roughly 12 passengers each and a skeleton crew of a single pilot. Besides the fact that sending under-loaded transports doesn't make sense, this would only leave 78 Resistance members on Crait. That doesn't wash with the numbers on the scene in the battle. Both the [rear trenches] (https://i.imgur.com/9AM2khG.jpg) and [forward trenches] (https://i.imgur.com/MI4jDK6.jpg) are packed, plus 3 people on each big turret. Carry that math over to the [rest of the trench and  big gun layout] (https://i.imgur.com/Z4IhKLs.jpg) and it's roughly 150 Resistance members.",1

Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge Of The Sith The Videogame

To everyone here on Reddit who likes Dueling and/or PVP/PVE games, and/or also like  Star Wars and the untold lore around Ep. 3. This game is for you! i love  this game personally and have beaten it many times.

it has  superb combat and amazing duels against classic characters as well as  characters not introduced in the movies, as well as fighting against  never before seen droids and clone fighter types. the levels in game  explore famous scenes from the movies while going much deeper into the  plot, narrative and story-telling.

Along with a versus mode where you can plug in a second controller and try to best your friend/enemy in a test of skill and might!

Above is a Unlock-able Alternate  Ending. no need to explain, just watch the video, it show cases the  beautiful combat and story-telling the game has to offer.

i could  go on for days about this game and love it from the bottom of my soul.i  sincerely hope you will love playing it as much as i do.

You will have to get your old PS2 or OG XBOX to play this. And as long as your console works well enough, you'll be able to play this game  buttery-smooth and lag-free. Despite its slightly low level graphics, it  makes up for it in fluid story telling and gameplay and Lore-Expansion. ",1

"So, can somebody give me the lowdown on Blaster Bolt colors?I’ve noticed throughout the Star Wars Saga that 4 different colors of blaster bolts/ship laser bolts are used:

Red: Rebel blasters, Stormtrooper (Empire and FO) blasters, CIS blasters and Droideka/SBD wrist guns, X-Wings, A-Wings, Rebel Y-Wings, Rebel turbolasers, Vulture Droids, various factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Blue: Republic Blasters, Resistance Blasters, Ion charged weapons, when any gun is set to stun it fires blue circles, Republic Y-Wings, Republic turbolasers, various different factions of pirates/smugglers/bounty hunters

Green: TIEs, Imperial turbolasers, Naboo Royal Guard blasters

Yellow: Mandalorian blasters


But I’ve never seen a satisfactory answer as to what they all mean in universe.  Obviously outside of universe the different colors are simply a design choice to make the battles look more colorful and to keep track of who’s who, but in universe it kind of seems like it should have an explanation.

I’ve seen a couple explanations, but none feel quite right:

1. The color is equal to the quality/type of gas used to create the bolt.
This theory posits that red bolts are lower quality gas, blue bolts are ion infused gas meant for taking down electronics/droids, and yellow and green are simply higher-end/more expensive gas

I like this theory, except it exposes a few problems, mostly with the blue gas being ion infused.  Blue bolts are used by both the Republic and the Resistance, along with many pirates and smugglers in TCW, if blue gas was ion infused, it would make sense for Clones to be using it as it would be more effective against droids, but the Resistance and the pirates in TCW would have no reason to use it.  Also, if blue lasers are better at taking down electronics, why wouldn’t all ships have blue lasers, regardless of faction?


2. The colors don’t change anything about the bolt, it’s simply a “tracer” or a way to know who’s firing at who.

This theory has more real world relevance, as real bullets will sometimes be used as “tracers” that leave little marks of color behind as they fly, this allows the shooter to see where he shot and readjust his aim accordingly, as well as to keep track of who is shooting what weapon.  This makes perfect sense in the Star Wars universe, except when it comes to the Rebels and the Empire.  If switching between colors was as simple as flipping a switch, and if it was common practice to use a different color than your enemy, why would the Rebels have kept their blasters at red?  It wouldn’t really make sense...

So, that’s why I’m curious if any of you guys have any theories or ideas as to what the different blaster colors could mean?

I know it doesn’t really matter, but I’m a sucker for these nitpicks details, and exploring the deep Star Wars Lore is one of my favorite things to do",1

"The Nebulon B can’t have hangars and I don’t get why legends and now seemingly canon wants to say they do.I’m a big ship fan, and the nebulon B is probably one of the most love hate relationships anyone could have with a ship. My biggest issue though is the insistence the ship has hangars because not only does it not make spacial sense but it turns lando into an asshole. Now I wouldn’t be opposed to it having a modification to add a hangar instead of being a medical frigate or whatnot but by default it makes no sense for it to have one. Not only would it have had to have been big and visible in episode 5 scale wise but if that were the case lando would’ve made a one handed luke climb a ladder instead of just walking out to the medical facility. Now it isn’t entirely too late, and I hope someone from lucasfilm reads this, but since it’s never been seen (Star Wars 4 did show a hangar that seemed like it was from a nebulon but it’s outline didn’t fit, it’s likely a dedicated hangar vessel) and only said to be a carrier in the rebel files (which could mean like the gozanti). But seriously, let’s not be legends and ruin all sense of consistency and scale by not caring, and let’s make the nebulon B be a shining example of such. ",1

"What is the most efficient Star Wars fleet?So yeah, what do you guys think is the most efficient Star Wars fleet? Keep in mind factors such as limited resources and political factors.

​

Personally, I think my ""dream fleet"" would look something like this:

Primary Battlecruiser: Bulwark Mk. 3. The Bulwark has lots of cargo space, high firepower and great shielding, but is fairly expensive but is known for sometimes having complications in electronics and sensors, and I would obviously get that fixed. The Bulwark would be the main frontline ship for my fleet, having good shields and high firepower, plus the cargo space which could be used for fighters and troop transport.

​

Carrier: Venator-Class Star Destroyer. The Venator, thanks to its ventral hangar, can deploy fighters in record time. With some modifications to improve its hangar space, the Venator would make a great addition to my fleet.​

&amp;#x200B;

Corvette: CR90 Blockade Runner: Small, fast, maneuverable and very modifiable, the CR90 is perfect alongside the Bulwark and MC60 as a screener ship, dealing with fighters and smaller capital ships with its array of blaster cannons. This version would have some of its engines removed or significantly reduced in size to allow rear sightlines, making the ship significantly slower, but giving it a much more effective firing angle against enemy ships, and reducing any fuel or energy costs from the massive engine array.

&amp;#x200B;

Frigate: MC60. The MC60 is small, fast, and very durable for its small size, and would, in this case, be modified to have more point-defense cannons. It is also known for its ability to quickly release its load, allowing for clusterbombs, proximity mines or even just random scrap to be released quickly, giving the MC60 extra utility.

​

Superiority Figher: HMP Droid Gunship. This gunship is big, decently well-shielded, and has huge firepower, and independently rotating cannons, allowing it to attack multiple enemies at once. This fighter, being very expensive, would be fairly rare, but would act as a great supportive element for the cheaper fighters, especially with its variety of missiles.

​

Swarm Fighter: Droid TIE Fighters. The Empire has experimented with droid-controlled TIE fighters, and considering the way TIE fighters are designed to be used, this sounds like a great idea. These TIEs would have a redesigned wing pattern to make them a little smaller, and be more easily crammed together in a ship, and would be released in large groups together, using their droid nature to coordinate group attacks and have great reflexes. These TIEs would be given photon bombs instead of missiles, and would be commonly used for risky mass bombing runs and as a screen against enemy fighters.

​

Special Ordinance: Repair Missiles: Special missiles filled with small droids similar to the Buzz Droids from the Clone Wars, but instead of tearing ships apart, they would repair them. These would help extend the lifespan of fighters out in the field, especially the HMPs.

"""at least Ackbar didn't die off screen like he did in Legends""Okay this is just a minor thing but seeing as how I'm reading the book where this happens I felt like talking about it. I feel like it because it is my favorite book in the entire New Jedi Order series and includes one of my favorite Space Battles in all of Star Wars. A battle that is akbar's last great act. 

Destiny's way is all about being a turning point. not for the characters because most of them have already completed their major arcs for the series but for the war itself. And Akbar is front and center in this book. He is treated as this Wise Old Statesman who is sick and dying but wants to Still help save the Republic. He is shown being tired and physically frail and not being able to be out of the water much while still being intelligent and even having the president and the current leader of the galactic Navy offering him their spots.

At the end of the book he comes up with this large multi-layered trap that destroys the enemies ability to wage a offensive War. Sadly he does technically die off screen but he dies at the end of the battle so it's sort of a somber moment doing this great Victory where is the heroes realize that they have lost this great Statesman who was the one who gave them this victory.

now let's compare that to the ackbar we see in The Last Jedi. Instead of getting multiple scenes with the main characters and having one of the minor plots revolve around him he is in the background of two or three scenes. His death is also treated as just a minor footnote it happens in the background and he just gets lumped in with everybody else that died during the attack.

so yeah he did die off screen of peaceful old age in a book where he is Central to the plot of defeating the enemy. and yes books have more time than movies to develop characters and plot and blah blah blah but the book with all of its Pages didn't have to include Ackbar.",1

"Snoke: a jed'aii?Before the Jedi knights or Sith came into existence. The force sensitive people were known as the jed'aii. 

[This video is more in depth](https://youtu.be/zVtYgI8B_18)

They came before the jedi, and, unlike the jedi or sith did not get involved with planetary affairs and instead kept to themselves and focused on meditation on their home planet. But one thing I noticed is that their teachings are not focused on the dark side, or the light, their goal was to balance both dark and light. 

I could not help to bring this up because the first thing I thought of when hearing that was supreme leader snoke. Supreme leader snoke was obsessed with the balance of dark and light. He didn't only use the dark or only use the light. He used both the dark and the light, balanced. 

Even more so snoke leads the first order. And the jeda'ii were the first order to study the force. 

But one thing I hear you say is ""the jedaii were aincent, if snoke were a jedaii he wouldn't be alive.""

Then I ask you to look at Darth nihlus and Darth sion. Both Sith powerful enough to cheat death. If you use the force enough you can cheat death and keep yourself form dying form at least old age. Not necessarily form other people (ie: kylo killed snoke) but he can at least keep himself fkrm perishing from at least age. This would be why snoke hid himself in the outer religions until the Emporer was killed. Because he knew the Emporer was a threat. He could keep himself form dying form aging but he could stop himself form being killed by another force user. This is why he looks so disfigured, because he is so old and he has used the force to stop himself form death and most decay, but still ceases to look alive.

"Where were the jedi masters?SPOILER WARNING - MENTIONS NEW MOVIES

So I've seen all of the new Disney Star Wars films, and despite all of the great and horrible missteps that they've made, one thing is really ticking me off. Where were all the jedi masters when Luke's New Jedi Order was massacred by Ben Solo/Kylo Ren? Ben attacked because he though Luke was going to kill him, and somehow destroyed the entire temple? We know that after Order 66, roughly 2% or 200 of the Jedi survived. Of these 200, about 100-140 were hunted down and killed by Vader and the Inquisitors or were turned to the dark side. So that leaves roughly 60 Jedi, if the stat I saw was correct. Now not all of these Jedi would join the new order, as some were opposed or self-eciled themselves. But at least some had to return, right? At least a dozen, if not more, of the Jedi would have rejoined to help train the future Jedi. But somehow, some untrained padawan-level Jedi is able to get a few of his friends and just destroy everything? 

And I know that those numbers are from the legends universe which isn't canon ectera ectera. But at the very least, what about the Jedi who Luke was training before Kylo/Ben? Kylo/Ben destroyed the New Order somewhere between 28 and 34 ABY. If the second Death Star was blown up in 4 ABY, then Luke had roughly 20 years to train other Jedi. Where were these ones? Or are we ment to belive that Kylo/Ben, who was the equivalent of a padawan learner, was able to gather a few of his friends and topple the rest of the Jedi who had been training for at least 20 years? And that each and every one of the New Order Jedi just happened to be at the new temple at the same time so that they could be killed by Kylo/Ben?

"Star wars audio books for 6 year old?Hi all,

Like most kids, my son loves all things Star Wars.  He especially likes listening to Star Wars audio books in the car.  Currently he is listening to the kids ""read along"" versions of the original trilogy, which are heavily abridged and only about 15 minutes long.  I grabbed a copy of the ""Dark Forces: Soldier of the Empire"" audio book from the library and I was blown away!  It had great voice acting and sound effects.  My son was enthralled listening to it.  Unfortunately it hit on a few too many adult themes (genocide, etc) for a six year old so we had to stop listening to the disappointment of the entire family.

So I'm searching for recommendations for another audio book along the same lines.  I like the dramatic ""radio play"" style of storytelling from the Dark Forces book, and the length seemed about perfect (2 hours).  I'm a lot less interested in the long unabridged versions of the novels.  Does anyone have any recommendation for similar books with less violence and adult themes?  It doesn't have to be kids versions of the stories, adult versions are fine, so long as they are appropriate.  I'm especially interested in audio books with the same level of production polish.",1

"A Thought on Luke's Reason For Hiding On Ahch-ToLuke didn't just see Ben Solo's future, but also his own, on the night he saw that Ben Solo was lost to the dark side. From that moment forward Luke knew he had two choices, *kill Ben Solo*, or *allow Kylo Ren to destroy everything he lives to protect*.

Luke is in a sort of purgatory on Ahch-To, he knows that if he joins The Resistance in battle he will eventually encounter Kylo, and when he does he will be faced with those two choices, *killing Kylo* (the choice he is disgusted with himself for even have considered for a brief moment), or *facing his own death*, and dying the way Obi-Wan did in his duel with Vader in A New Hope (allowing Kylo to strike him down will further strengthen the dark side's hold on Ben Solo).

Luke sees that living the life of the legendary warrior *Luke Skywalker* means he has to face this decision. So he walks away from his life as *Luke Skywalker*, removing himself from the story that is unfolding across the galaxy, and living the life of a farmer on Ahch-To, the sort of life he once dreamed of escaping on Tatooine before his name became legend. 

It's not until Luke sees a way to meet Kylo in battle, without having to make either of these choices, that he is freed from his *purgatory*, and becomes one with the force having completed his journey. 

Just an idea to consider. Let me know what you think. ",1

"Why didn't Yoda help save Master Luminara?We know they were both on Kashyyyk when Order 66 was enacted and it seems to me that, while very dangerous, the situation was still somewhat ideal to attempt locating Luminara and escaping with her:

- Yoda had beheaded the Commander (and I believe 2nd in command also) of Green company, meaning the clones would be somewhat disorganized
- The droid army was still very much active and engaged in live fighting with the clones so factions of the military would still be occupied with that
- Luminara was a well renown Jedi Master who could have proved very useful in the fight against the Sith

Ultimately we know she was captured and used as bait to trap and kill other Jedi who had decided to brave the apparent danger and tried to rescue her.

So I understand we don't know what will happen with Kylo during IX.  But just going off where Kylo is currently at, what do you think Ani would say to him?


I think Ani would say something like ""You excuse what you want to do and embrace by justifying to yourself and the world that it's done in my name.  But I don't condone this and whether or not I were around, you would pursue your path because deep down, you just want to embrace the dark side.

"I'm an inhabitant of the Galaxy, sell me on joining the Rebelsistance after TLJPrior to TLJ when I won't join the Rebelsistance:

* The Rebelsistance has a somewhat significant army and fleet

* Luke Skywalker, a legendary jedi who defeated the Empire, is still alive

* The Rebelsistance has support from various groups/planets

* The Rebelsistance has connections to power-brokers and arms dealers within the galaxy, allowing them to arm their forces

* 5 Planets have been destroyed and have done nothing to rouse me to action


After TLJ:

* The Rebelsistance military is virtually non-existent. A small city's police force could handily defeat them at this point.

* Luke Skywalker is dead. Regardless of how ""inspiring"" his death was, it doesn't change the fact that the most valuable asset against the First Order did no lasting damage to it and is gone forever.

* Every ally the Rebelsistance had has abandoned them. 

* The Rebelsistance has suddenly grown a moral opposition to purchasing/using weapons in war. Of course, this doesn't really matter since 17% of the Rebelsistance's forces made a point of destroying any relationship they had with the galaxy's arms dealers, going so far as to steal the personal ship of one of their sellers.

* I don't believe in the Force, something that is essentially a myth in the galaxy at this point. Any mumbo-jumbo about Luke dying or being the ""spark that ignites the coals that rekindles the flame that burns the First Order"" falls on deaf ears. I care about facts and results, not children's stories.

All of a sudden in Episode V he is force pulling a light saber from the frozen ice. 
I dont really understand?

So my question is, why did Anakin go through years of training with Obi Wan in order to be a Jedi, meanwhile Luke meets an old man who tells him about the force and that's it, Luke is man handling the force.

Another point is, if Luke was able to learn to use the force without any instruction, then why is there so much criticism for Rey learning the force in TFA?

•As of right now, the SW universe feels small. The governmental structure of the galaxy was destroyed (I guess) in TFA. Who is running this joint now? Establishing rules on how planets are being ran and the FO’s effect on them would solidify why they are the bad guys and would add stakes to the whole ordeal.

•Here’s maybe stretching for some of us, but still food for thought: what if midiclorians were to fundamentally change? Imagine a scenario where they could no longer harbor the force as we have come to expect. Maybe they lose that all so important balance. What if this change turned force users insane and the whole film was the resistance and FO working together to try and take on a now powerful Rey and Ren?

It is hard to think of stuff to do in this universe after this movie, jeez.",1

"A way to improve the AOTC duel.So after the warm up with the rocks and force lightning with Yoda, at the point where Dooku says the part about the contest being decided with lightsaber skills, Yoda should have shrugged his cloak and proceeded to easily repel Dooku and hold his ground without ever drawing his lightsaber. Then cut to the scene of an exhausted Dooku using the force to topple the pillar toward Kenobi and Skywalker.

I feel this would have had the same wow factor to the kids, with less cheesiness to the adults. It would have also kept more in line with Yoda as a character, and shown his clear superiority to Dooku. It also would have kept more suspense for the moment Yoda finally draws his saber in battle against Sidious, then shown his small reguard for it when the sabers were cast aside as strength in the force became more the deciding factor. It would explain why Yoda never trained Luke on saber technique and focused on the force. He knew what Luke was going to have to defeat, and that a lightsaber would be a mere toy. '",1

"What is the point?By the end of TLJ, the New Republic is established as being dead (which pisses me off tbh), Luke is dead, Leia will also die, the resistance has no fleet, no allies, nothing. Just some slave children telling stories while the FO ""takes over the major systems"" in just a few weeks. So what really is the point of fighting?

Let me explain.
 By the end of it TLJ we are back at the Status Quo of the original trilogy, with the Empire (FO, cheap) now ruling supreme and the Rebellion (Resistance, very cheap) now back at being underdogs. But by all we see so far in universe, at least what we can infer, no one really gives a damn about the FO destroying the NR's capital, either the planets just bow down to it or are indifferent. This we can see by how none of the ""allies"" responds to Leia's pleas, and how the FO keeps saying that with the Resistance destroyed the last breath of the Republic will have died out. 

So maybe Kylo has a point, why are we still holding on? What is the point of keeping with the Idea of Republicanism, Resistance, Rebellion, whatever if there is nothing worth fighting for? If the galaxy actually gave two shits about liberty and justice they would've been up in arms and be in mass to fight against the FO, but they didn't, not even after the destruction of their secret weapon (Starkiller) and a major part of their forces. It's just the resistance and their miniscule ""fleet"" and abysmally small numbers and soldiers who see what the ground tastes like. 

What is the point of a Resistance if there is no real end goal to the resisting when no one actually gave a damn about what the first Rebellion, Luke, Leia, Han, and so many others fought for... Maybe we should just let the FO reign and be content with the fact that the Republic is dead, liberty is gone, resistance is futile, and all our heroes are failures.

I mostly blame all this with the bad writing, but that doesn't matter anymore. ",1
"Would it be realistic for Ahsoka to have PTSD?So I saw a post about how obi wan realistically has PTSD and that got me thinking, could Ahsoka realistically have it too? 

After all she's participated in multiple battles during the clone wars, which would expose her to a lot of death and atrocities. She's survived the jedi purge, in which nearly everybody she new was brutally killed by men she thought were good, loyal people. Those who weren't killed by clones were decimated by a sith who stormed the jedi temple killing everyone in it. She also found out that the Republic that she swore to defend was being controlled and manipulated by a sworn enemy of her religion, who also orchestrated the downfall of her former mentor. After all that, she had found out about force sensitive  children being taken by the empire which probably would've brought her flashbacks to when Sidious attempted that during the clone wars and her and the babies nearly died. 

Let's not forget that she died and was brought back to life by a literal God whoch would definetly freak her out. She also found out that the man who had been known as the jedi hunter, the vile one who had led operation knightfall was her master who was like a brother to her.

However I'm still feeling hyped for the show, after seeing the ""Meet the team "" video it looks a loot better with really impressive lighting on the backgrounds that I'm sure will give wonderful screenshots. There were moments where the animation got a little stiff I'm not going to lie but there is always room for improvement. And overall it's just looks fun, maybe too energetic fun(witch some might say it doesn't fit the SW tone) but still pretty fun, the main character looks likable and the older characters give the impression that we might see some serious moments in the series. If they explore the galaxy in it's post civil war state and treat the espionage scenes with at least a little seriousness I'll be very happy with it.

"This kinda bothered me a bit: Stealing SpaceshipsTLDR at bottom

It’s not like a huge annoyance but one of those things that kinda piles up over the movies and takes away from the experience for me. Thinking about the new trilogy, stealing spaceships happens a lot and it’s never really addressed or explained a lot of the time. Here is the list I could think of off the top of my head.

1. TIE Fighter stolen by Finn and Poe. This one makes the most sense thematically and logically. Finn needs a pilot but probably could get them onto the ship with whatever you need to start TIE fighters as he is a member of the first order. Interesting escape ensued, fun times and totally acceptable. Also note that the first order immediately gave chase. 

2. Millennium Falcon stolen by Finn and Rey. This one was the first time I really rolled my eyes at the new movies. And not getting into flying the ship, just the act of stealing it. Like was it just sitting there unlocked, fueled and ready to go? Wouldn’t space ships have some sort of defense system so you couldn’t walk on and just start it up and go? Also if you add in the fact that the Falcon would be well known (probably the only ship to help blow up both Death Stars including physically being the one to blow up the second), wouldn’t it be a prized possession, like a historical artifact almost, not just some piece of junk you leave laying around for someone to steal. It kinda felt like the last action hero when Schwarzenegger could find the keys to any car by looking in the sun visor. But I don’t think it really hurt the movie that much but was an eyebrow raiser for sure. 

3. Resistance ship stolen by Finn and Rose (with Poe’s help?). So before Finn and Rose go on there horrible Las Vegas vacation, they take a ship from the resistance to get there. This is stealing because earlier when Finn tried to escape via escape pod, Rose was given the oh so important task of making sure people didn’t desert the cause. So if they are guarding the fucking escape pods (I mean she was morning her sister but clearly there was standing orders to stop any deserts or something) I’d imagine that actual space ships that can go to warp would have more security to prevent the same thing. It makes some logical sense they could start the ship and maybe fly it (Finn has been established that he is not mechanically inclined so maybe rose knows how to?), and Poe probably had to like convince the guards to look the other way Or something? But wouldn’t they notice a ship missing? Did no one see it leave or detect it leaving with their scanners? It seems like an obstacle that would have been interesting to actually see (instead of say, a pack of alien horses running through town?) This also establishes that ships are now stolen off screen with little effort put into what happened. 

4. Libertine yacht stolen by DJ and BB-88. Like the first entry, this makes a little more sense as of anyone, DJ’s character specializes in this sort of thing and I’m sure some dumb comic goes into it, but it happens entirely off screen. A side note, how did they know where Finn and Rose would be to pick them up? That was lucky considering they didn’t seem to come up with a plan prior to escaping. Whatever, talented splicer with droid that can do anything steal a ship, believable if not very convenient and entirely not explained. 

5. FO shuttle stolen by Finn and Rose. Jesus Finn has be a part of stealing like 5 ships so far. This one is the laziest, their shuttle just shoots out of the main ship after holdos sacrifice. Uh what? I doubt Finn would still be able to get codes to start the shuttle and I imagine more storm troopers would be piling into these to flee the sinking ship or go down to the surface where the rebels are. So like these shuttles just sit around unlocked, fully ready to launch, just waiting for anyone to walk on and go? I mean can you just walk onto an aircraft carrier and hop into a fighter and take off? Wouldn’t a military organization have some sort of protocols for launching spaceships? Again, super convenient and done 100% off screen. But hey at least some fighters gave chase! Which leads us to

6. Supreme Commander Snoke’s escape craft stolen by Rey. I lied last entry, this one is the laziest by far. I mean this isn’t some shuttle or TIE fighter, but the head guys personal craft. What? How? How did she even know this was a thing? How did she get passed any security procedures? Why do we never see this craft? Also remember how I mentioned that the FO gives chase after the other two ships are stolen (numbers 1 and 5), were there no Fighters sent after this? If this was like Air Force One wouldn’t it have its own pilot and crew just in case of emergency, does like joke, sorry Snoke, fly this craft by himself?! Wouldn’t they know something was up if Snoke’s personal ship left and like send guards to the throne room? So many questions and the amount of explanation is one throw-away line. 

7. Salt speeders by the resistance. Ok this one isn’t really “stealing” because I think they said it was an old rebel/resistance base? But it is similar in the idea of ships just magically appearing to serve a plot purpose. It makes kinda sense that they would leave equipment behind and the ships seemed not in great condition but I feel this would be a great spot for a scene like the end of a new hope or beginning of empire with people running around prepping speeders, quick repairs, refueling, pilots getting ready, etc. like establish these speeders and set it all up, build the tension. I only saw TLJ like 1.5 times so maybe this happened but I sincerely can’t remember. Also, this set up scene is where you should of had rose confront Finn about not going out to kill himself and stops him by revealing her feelings. That would make a million times more sense than the speeder crash idea. 


TLDR: So there you have 6 (or 7) times that spaceships, shuttles, space yacht, and fighters have been stolen in the new trilogy and while some of them have made sense (mainly only the first time), the majority are either illogical, happen off screen, seem exceedingly convenient, or are a big missed opportunity for an interesting obstacle. And while these things in themselves don’t make the movies bad, they are like little needles that add up with all the other stuff to lessen my enjoyment of the movies. ",1
"Star Wars, the clone theory.Then it all clicked. 

The mass conspiracy of the Empire to continue along their treacherous path and the illuminating answer to the plaguing questions of who the parents of these remarkable children are.

Star Wars, the clone theory.

Who are Rey's parents? What about Finn? The answer doesn't have to be a furtive affair clandestinely glossed over to not blemish otherwise pristine Jedis. The empire has access to and uses cloning technology to build war machines however they were largely unsuccessful in and of theirselves and only useful as cannon fodder to swarm more powerful enemies in hopes of crushing their foes. Even though they ultimately were successful the next logical step wouldn't be to continue to clone Boba Fett, it would be to clone powerful force users to ensure that each individual member was powerful in their own right. 

Using access to genetic data on hand it would be possible to reproduce great force users throughout history and have an unstoppable army indoctrinated from an early age. However instead of training these individuals to use the force and potentially usurp the mantle of Sith lord they were instead trained as fierce soldiers who would use their latent force abilities unconsciously to ensure their own survival and ultimately the aims of the dark side. It all began with the creation of Anakin. 

After spending half a lifetime attempting to create the most powerful being in the galaxy and claim them as his apprentice Sidious obviously saw the folly of attempting to subvert a force that seemingly had its own will and fickle whims that would supersede any of his strategiery. Why ask the force to create powerful disciples when he could use technology at hand to do so and not have to comb through astronomical expanses of space to find them. Worse yet the arduous process of having to have to reprogram them to his will, a task only made increasingly difficult if they're already diametrically opposed to him. Thats not even taking into account what would happen if this being were to grow more powerful than their creator on their own cognizance and refuse to bow down to an inferior master. 

The only sensible way to create a new disciple that would stand up to the might of Vader would be to tap into the most powerful force user that Sidious knew, one who would make a worthy disciple and had a natural affinity for the dark side of the force. Unbeknownst to anyone while the events of the original saga were occurring a nefarious scheme was taking root that would reverberate through the protagonists lifetimes and beyond.

The pieces are in place.

Something happened between Luke and the Knights of Ren that made him abscond to the nether reaches of space. Was he running away, had he finally given up his lifelong pursuit of justice and peace? Maybe he discovered a nefarious plot and decided to exile himself and his historic midichlorian count to keep it out of the hands of a new sinister overlord. 

Something happened to Snoke that left him horribly disfigured and scarred (seemingly by a white hot light saber). Even then there are so many unanswered questions. Who taught him the ways of the Sith? Why is he such an incredibly strong force user when such people are ostensibly only one out of tens or hundreds of billions? Why does he seem to match descriptions of Darth Plageuis the Wise? How does he have such intimate knowledge of events and details he simply wasn't around for? It just seems like such a Sidious action to clone his mentor to claim as a secret disciple for the inevitability of Vader's demise. It also falls in line with the expected machinations of the Sith Lord. It even stands to reason that after being brought up in the wings the Plagueis clone picked up where his master left off knowing full well of his own lineage and setting off to gather the necessary components to eviscerate the last bastions of the Jedi, even succeeding where his master failed; he would cultivate powerful force users and ensure they were loyal to him to amass an army the likes of which has never been seen. 

Something happened to Rey, who are her parents and why does she have such an indelible and incredibly strong affinity for the force? Why did she only see herself when she went seeking her parents in the dark side cave? Why would someone (presumably Luke) try to hide her on a planet where nobody could find her as opposed to giving her shelter with loved ones as Ben Kenobi did? A Kenobi cut down the first Skywalker, why not try to clone another Kenobi to take out the Skywalker again? If she were a Kenobi then surely Luke sensed it in the force and presumably that's why this small harmless child was singled out to be protected from sinister forces, otherwise why would someone care so much about an unseeming, random child ?

What about Finn? Just some random janitor in a faceless, nameless organization and yet Kylo Ren was fully aware of who he was - almost as if he was keeping tabs on him. How does a lowly janitor get into a lightsaber duel with a Sith master and live to tell the tale? Just like Princess Leia just because force powers aren't bursting forth doesn't mean they're not nascent. Still waters run deep and who else but one of the most renowned light saber duelists in Jedi history to clone in an attempt to fortify your foot soldiers. If this were the case it would be likely they've been tracking FN for a long time but have had doubts about his proclivity to the dark side. When Kylo Ren suddenly turns to him after not participating in the massacre of the first movie was indicative that he was paying particular attention to his actions. More glaringly why would he choose this lowly janitor to accompany him and why would he remember his call sign out of the possibly thousands of soldiers stationed at that very base. Kylo doesn't continue throughout the movie referring to each lowly storm trooper individually. 

The new Star Wars isn't some shoddy rehashing of a formulaic and arcane tale but rather the last vestiges of a cold and ruthless emperor whose cunning is still being felt through the galaxy. ",1

"I honestly don't really want star wars spinoff movies...They have already done solo and I think now they should stop, the spinoffs are planned to explain many of he iconic characters in the old trilogy like Obi Wan and Boba Fett, and I honestly don't want them. Everysingle character does not have to be explained fully, I mean, Boba Fett, he is a bounty hunter, he hasn't got a fully explained story because he doesn't need to, you could say he's a pretty mysterious character, his backstory is not that clear, and so tell me why would we need a full movie for his backstory? This can only do more bad than good, an iconic original character potentially ruined with a painful movie spinoff, I really don't think its worth the risk to ruin some of the best movie characters in history.

I personally believe it's better left untold, all that can come out of it is a ruined character, if you don't explain the backstory then you don't have to get hundreds of people disagreeing on how it should've went, it seems to me all the spinoffs are just a moneygrab, because there is simply no need for they're existence. What might interest me however, is maybe a ""Snoke"" spinoff, explaining who Snoke is and how he became so powerful, that would be much better, because TLJ didn't do a good job at that at all, and just killed off his character instead.

Does anyone else agree with me?",1
"Episode IX TheoriesI think the resistance knows they’re in trouble and need alliances. I think we know they go Lando, who probably has knowledge and connections. One key bit of intelligence is the location of a “retired” Admiral Thrawn (Matt Smith). Thrawn has no allegiance to The First Order... in fact, Snoke’s species is a rival to the Chiss Ascendancy in the Outer Rim. The resistance wants to recruit Thrawn, convincing him that the FO is a danger to the Chiss.

Now, this potential storyline would have been a lot more viable if Snoke was still alive, but there possible ways around this. I think Disney wants to keep tying the universe together with familiar characters. Thrawn is a favorite and the latest book shows his alliance is primarily Chiss and he is honorable. 

Of course, Thrawn vs. the FO wouldn’t be fair... he would easily destroy them, so that’s kind of a problem too, unless more of Snoke’s kind show up to be a rival.

In the vein of familiar faces. Is there any reason we may not see Enfys Nest in IX? It seems like she would be the perfect age now to show up. Armor a little more worn and grittier, but maybe a disillusioned.

I’m just throwing out some ideas. There’s nothing that needs to be “wrapped up” quite honestly, so it feels like we need something like familiar characters coming back in and giving a “Dirty Dozen” feel to take on the remnants of the FO and Knights of Ren.",1

"Episode IX idea: Kyber crystal bleeding, force planets, and moreMy idea is that in Episode IX, Kylo calls to his grandfather. Vader’s force ghost appears, and as he walks towards Kylo he morphs from the Vader suit to ROTS Anakin, played by Hayden. Somehow through this conversation (where Anakin would try to convince Kylo to the light, tell him to not fall down the same path he did himself) Kylo would reject his fanboyism of his grandfather. 

Now, we know that Kylo’s saber needs two extra blade-ports because they help stabilized his cracked kyber crystal. I believe that the reason he goes through the effort of  using a cracked crystal is because it’s the crystal from Vader’s saber, which was cracked after being destroyed in the destruction of the second Death Star. Kylo would reject this now, as it was a symbol of his obsession over his grandfather. He would somehow end up with the crystal from Rey’s (partially destroyed) saber, and he would bleed it to the dark side (this would look amazing in live-action, IMO). Rey would use Luke’s greensaber to fight Kylo in the climax of the movie, and after defeated him she, alongside the force ghost of Luke (and if we really want to step it up: Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin), would purify it back and it would turn white on the Wellspring of Life, the force planet Yoda visited in TCW that was the source of midichlorians and all life of the galaxy.

The movie would end on Luke, Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda’s force ghosts all together, peacefully watching as the Resistance truly restore order back to the galaxy, and Rey begins training a new generation of Jedi with her purified saber.
I like the idea of the saber being bled and purified because this saber has been through everything, and been wielding by all of the most powerful force-users: Anakin, Kenobi, Rey; Kylo (who bleeds it) then back to Rey as she purifies it on the Wellspring or Life, which I’d love to see. Such a cool concept for a planet that we haven’t seen more of.

That’s it. I think the force ghost thing at the end might be a bit over the top but I like it. Any improvements or other ideas?",1

"A Clone Wars Related Question and maybe possible discussion.. Since Disney took over and the canon changed, we have so many things that are missing details from big to small during the clone wars/prequel era.  I'll keep it simple and ask where does the Clone Wars start for you? While Canon says its with the CGI 2008 show starting with the Episode Cat and Mouse, my concern is thatmany things arent really introduced/explained. For example: Anakins changes, Obi-Wans changes, Grievous, Ventress and more. Its like they were all tossed in and for all of us who know go ""oh yea! I remember you"" but most people who follow whats ""canon"" will still wonder. When did they come into play? I know Star Wars doesnt always need an intro for characters/things, but the 2D 2003 Clone Wars cartoon, while in the later episodes have some continuity issues and is considered no longer canon, had a pretty solid start to the clone wars, introductions, and character changes. It could also easily be considered canon just for the first 21 episodes alone (which is like an hour and 15 total). So I personally feel like that is where it begins.

"Does it bother anyone else to hear people say “I just want the Skywalker story to end so we can focus on other things”?Call me old fashioned, but I believe what makes Star Wars so great IS the Skywalker story.

"WHAT IF: Anakin had died at Mustafar at OB-1's hands? my theoryLet me see: Order 66 had alredy been issued and carried out; Palpatine had an army and Yoda, the only surviving Jedi Master, didn't have ~~a Hulk~~ any Jedi to fight him back; OTOH, at that point Darth Maul and Darth Dracula were dead so Palpatine would have no Sith disciple nor prospect. The Geonosians had already began building the Death Star and Tarkin was already around. So the Galactic Empire is established just the same, less the Emperor's Force Enforcer, DV. 
  
(Supposedly Anakin lived only because Palpatine Force-siphoned Padme lifeforce to him; if this is to be believed, and he had died, Padme would live, and Luke and Leia wouldn't go to Tatooine and Alderaan; instead they'd be raised in Naboo. Since we never heard about Naboo in the OT is must not be a very influential planet. Just in case, someone cuts Representative Bink's head off so he won't do more damage.)  
    
Without DV around, Palpatine would probably be killed in a plot *à la* Operation Valkyrie, since it's clear he commands more fear than loyalty among the military, but assuming he would be not:  
  
The Battle of Scariff goes just as hard for the rebels but Admiral Squid's ship survives and the DS plans reach the rebel HQ sooner. Tarkin never hears of Yavin. The DS is destroyed before the inauguration at Alderaan.   

The rebels move to Hoth and have a calm winter. Admiral Ozzel never finds them. DV doesn't execute him, but Palpatine does.  
  
DS-2 plan is put in motion. Same result as ROTJ. Palps die.  

other main characters: Han is eventually killed by one of Jabba's twerps. Leia marries some Gungan stud. Luke becomes a Naboonian Baron. Yoda dies of old age in Dagobah. OB-1 stays with the Rebels until the final victory. Lando retires very wealthy and buys a dozen gold-plated YT-1300s, but dies poor because of the Galaxy's [financial crisis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09054).
  
tldr: OB1 brings balance to the force.

"Thinking of some new Star Wars sculpts; Demonic/Darkside Yoda? - LoreCraft  Hello there fellas,  
I do timelapse sculpts over on my youtube channel, and Halloween is coming up and I'm thinking of doing a myriad of ""Dark"" originals, like famous characters with a dark twist.    I did a poll on my tab there and got a lot of votes for Zombie Hulk, Dark Elf Link, Burnt Groot, etc, but one in particular I am thinking about doing is a Demonic or Dark Side Yoda.     
   Anyone that's interested, I did a Snoke Sculpture Timelapse several months ago (will put link in top comments), if you're interested in what I do.    
  Anyways, I was just looking for some feedback and thoughts from some people here, maybe some other ideas, or descriptions of how you may like a Dark Side/Demonic Yoda be portrayed if I do it.  Thanks all - LoreCraft",1

"TIL: Allan Dean Foster, the ghostwriter for the original novelization of Star Wars (A New Hope) was never *really* credited for having ""fleshed out the backstory of time, place, planets, races, history and technology in such detail that it became canonical for all subsequent Star Wars novels.""ALAN\*\*\*\*

Lucas brought to Foster the original screenplay, after which Foster fleshed out the backstory of time, place, planets, races, history and technology in such detail that it became canonical for all subsequent Star Wars novels. When asked if it was difficult for him to see Lucas get all the credit for Star Wars, Foster said, ""Not at all. It was George's story idea. I was merely expanding upon it. Not having my name on the cover didn't bother me in the least.""

"Why should we care if the Resistance wins?Why should we care whether or not the Resistance beats the First Order?

The New Republic was a complete failure, and chose to ignore the First Order threat, and they were destroyed for it.

The Resistance numbered about 400 people *before* they were nearly completely destroyed by the end of The Last Jedi. In the entire galaxy, only 400 people are willing to fight to destroy an objectively evil organization. 400 people. That's about the size of an elementary school.

A major theme in TLJ is how there isn't really ""good"" and ""bad"". ""Good guys, bad guys...Made-up words. Let's see who formally owns this gorgeous hunk. This guy was an arms dealer. Made his bank selling weapons to the bad guys. Oh, and the good ones. Finn, let me learn you something big. It's all a machine, partner. Live free, don't join."" The Jedi, the guardians of peace for thousands of years, are treated as abject failures.

There are no allies of the Resistance. Leia says she has allies, but none of them choose to help. Nobody in the galaxy cares whether or not the First Order takes over or not.

""Balance of the Force"" is reconned to mean equal parts light/dark, meaning that the conflict will never end.

So why should we, the audience, care? ",1

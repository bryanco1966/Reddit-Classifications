0,"The /r/books book club selection for September is Butter: A Rich History by Elaine KhosrovaFrom [Goodreads:](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28110851-butter)

&gt;  It’s a culinary catalyst, an agent of change, a gastronomic rock star. Ubiquitous in the world’s most fabulous cuisines, butter is boss. Here, it finally gets its due.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;After traveling across three continents to stalk the modern story of butter, award-winning food writer and former pastry chef Elaine Khosrova serves up a story as rich, textured, and culturally relevant as butter itself.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;From its humble agrarian origins to its present-day artisanal glory, butter has a fascinating story to tell, and Khosrova is the perfect person to tell it. With tales about the ancient butter bogs of Ireland, the pleasure dairies of France, and the sacred butter sculptures of Tibet, Khosrova details butter’s role in history, politics, economics, nutrition, and even spirituality and art. Readers will also find the essential collection of core butter recipes, including beurre manié, croissants, pâte brisée, and the only buttercream frosting anyone will ever need, as well as practical how-tos for making various types of butter at home--or shopping for the best.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

2,"A big thank you to whomever recommended Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight trilogy here about two months ago! I have not read a thousand page plus book that fast before!I read aloud to my boyfriend as a way for us to spend time together, which is great, but at times it's difficult to find a book we can both get excited about picking up every night. I stumbled across a Reddit post two months ago lauding The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson for its world building, and it made me curious. I downloaded the sample om nook and started reading it aloud that same afternoon. Since then, not a day has gone by that we didn't pick it up, no matter how late, even if we could only get through a couple pages before bed. We couldn't stop talking about it. Last night we finished the last page, and my boyfriend, who never goes to bookstores by himself, drove to Barnes and Noble and bought copies of the next two books in the series to surprise me with today. I would highly reccomend these books to anyone who enjoys epic fantasy, and thank you Reddit for helping me find it in the first place!",0

4,"I’ve done myself an injustice as a Stephen King fan and horror genre consumer.In all of my time reading, I’ve avoided picking up ‘It’ because the whole “creepy clown” spook factor never appealed to me, and I never really knew the book had more to offer than that. If you’re like me, and have avoided ‘It’ on the false premise that it’s primarily a book about a clown, I encourage you to keep reading past the first chapter. I’ll also add that I’ve been a little creeped out by many of King’s books, but this is the first King (and horror book in general) that has genuinely frightened me and made me want to keep all the lights on in my house at night.

5,"Just finished The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson and I'm blown away 

I've never seen world building like this before! The whole story was phenomenal, each sentence built up the plot and the world in which it took place! I'm also amazed by the shear amount that is taking place! There's so much to comprehend and take in, yet all of it seems like it's fully fleshed out, each object, place or person having there own goals and backgrounds, especially the side characters who barely make an appearance! This is hands down one of, if not the best book I've ever read.

6,"Shelby Foote’s The Civil War,Just started reading this book. A person who’s opinion I value recommended it to me.

But.

Something about the way Foote wrote about the south makes me feel uncomfortable. Almost like he sympathized with the confederacy, or at least romanticized it. 

Maybe I’m imagining it, maybe I’m not, maybe this book is simply an artifact of the era in which it was written.

I think I’m going to read through the book anyway. Reading things that make me uncomfortable is good once in a while, I don’t think we do it often enough as a society. 

I’d like to hear about other readers’ experiences with this book, if you care to share. What did you like about it? What did you think about it? Given the subject matter, I suppose spoilers are moot.",0

&amp;#x200B;

If you recall, a couple months ago I made a post about my school not having a library. The response from you all was amazing- I received an outpouring of generosity and donations, both in a normative sense, and in boxes and boxes of used books.

I love those books; the dog eared pages, scribbled notes in the margins, and ancient library stamps.  They bring history and character to my classroom, and my children know that real people somewhere cared enough to send them books, and their own books at that.  In addition to these well loved, amazing books, your donations allowed me to order an entire classroom set of novels, over 75 different books that range over so many different topics and areas of the literary world.

In an effort to keep this short, thank you.  Thank you a million times over and from the bottom of my heart.

9,"Correspondence with author of The Last Wild Men of BorneoDear Mr. Hoffman,

Just finished the last page of The Last Wild Men of Borneo and was sorry to. Such a fine book, but I was most impressed with your 18-day trek with the Penan. That is really deep diving into your subject material that few writers, maybe Sebastian Junger, would undertake. In my younger days as a hard rock exploration geologist I spent a lot of summers in the remote wilds of Northern British Columbia, hiking all day through Devil's Club and thick woods but then of course at the end of the traverse, a chopper would drop out of the sky and take us back to camp for dinner and a beer.

Anyways, I enjoyed Savage Harvest a lot and Wild Men too. Your books make for fine reading.

Oolican

Dear Oolican,

Thanks so much for your note, and for reading both Wild Men and SH. What I kept thinking during that time with the Penan was that Bruno had done that, lived that, for six years. You get used to conditions that you'd never tolerate at home, of course, fairly quickly, too, but still. Of course, Bruno did go frequently into Long Seridan and other villages, where creature comforts lay, but less and less as time passed and the pressure to capture him grew. Hard to imagine. As for me, yes, I thought about that dinner and that beer just as much as you. 

Anyway, thanks again for your gracious words. 

Best,

11,"Iliad and Odyssey TranslationsHello there!

I want to do my first read through of the Iliad and the Odyssey. I just read Dante’s Inferno translated by Allen Mandlebaum - which was surprisingly critical of the political dynamic of 13th century Florence. Though I made it through, I can’t help thinking there was a better way to experience that particular epic. 

I know there are plenty of translations for Homer’s work out there. I read a New Yorker article comparing the same passage across several translations. I’m leaning toward either Alexander Pope or Robert Fagle, but I want to hear your thoughts!

EDIT: On the same-ish topic, has anyone here read Circe by Madeline Miller? I’d be interested to hear thoughts on it. ",0

14,"Stephen King blew my mind and has now changed my lifeI always loved Stephen King movies and after seeing It in theaters about a year ago I decided I had to finally try reading some of his books. But growing up I always hated reading. And in the past few years I'd only read a handful of nonfiction books. But I decided to pick up Carrie, and found I loved it. Then I tried Salems Lot, and loved it even more, and realised I actually enjoyed reaading fiction. I think it was the way he writes small towns and develops his characters that really sucked me in, i fell in love with his writing. I managed to find a big stack of his books online for cheap, and started working my way through a lot of his biblioagraphy. I started to use the library, and read other authors, and now I love reading and try and find the time to read at least 1-2 hours a day. I kept a list on my phone and I've read over 50 books in just under a year, some smaller than others but still if you told me that a year ago I would've laughed in your face.

However, and this is anecdotal, after college, I hardly ever see anyone reading books. I highly doubt that even 50 percent of Americans read at least one single book from beginning to end. I know a lot of people tend to read the Bible and so they don’t get through it, and college text books that I guess many people count as reading the book(when they in fact skim through it).

18,"I messed up. How do I get used to reading textbooks on screens?This past week I had just started again at university. My professors were kind enough to give us a textbook made by the faculty members of our school, and since I prefer paper books to ebooks, I went to a print shop to get it copied (with permission from the profs involved).

Most of the important parts of the book were in gray boxes with no color necessary, so I got it printed in black and white, but didn't realize 'black &amp; white' actually means black and white and nothing in between. So basically I got a 700 page book that looked like every page was a redacted document from WW2.

So /r/books, how do you make reading textbooks on screens more tolerable? It's a pdf, so e-readers aren't a good option. I have a tablet I can carry around, but when I try to read them on my android tablet it seems like I can't remember anything. Also, not being able to flip around to important sections of the book while keeping the page I'm at is really slowing my progress on my readings and understanding the material. What do you suggest?

TLDR: Fucked up printing a textbook. What are your tips for reading textbooks on tablets/laptops?",0
19,"Question Re: Huxley’s “Brave New World”I’ve always really enjoyed this book, but one concept about the “World State” that has yet to click with me is the overall objective of this societal framework. I get that the general goal is to maintain a population that is content, controlled, and manageably small. But to what end? Who benefits from this arrangement? Is it stability for stability’s sake?

For instance, there is a class of people (betas? I can’t remember)  that are bred to be pleased with toiling away in a factory and always wanting band new things produced in said factories. 

Okay, got it. But are those factories privately owned and therefore profiting from this stable workforce? Alternatively, if the state owns the factories (which I assume is the case) to what end is all of this optimized workforce aimed? It’s a “World State”. Are they competing with someone? Why promote rabid consumerism, or any consumerism, if your factory doesn’t need to—say—build shareholder value? 

Thanks for your thoughts!",0
20,"Listening to an audiobook screwed up my book experienceYou know how when you're reading a fresh book you start assigning some voices to the characters and as you read it, it kind of develops until they are fully polished and you basically hear the conversations in your head.

Well while I was reading ""The Final Empire"" I decided that hey, I'm going to listen to the audiobook while I'm at the gym. What a mistake that was. The narrator is some older dude and he was doing a voice pretending to be a young woman. It was just so weird, and then every other character he exaggerated and added some weird accents, some weird tonation to their voices. It is extremely bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Now when I read, I can't stop hearing his voice mimicking the characters. I completely lost my ""set of voices""

&amp;#x200B;

Pls send help, how do I go back.

The narrator of the audiobook was reading it in a weird way and now when I came back to read the book I can only hear his weird voice in my head.",0

23,"The Never Hero is a very underrated book.I read this a few months back and was completely engulfed in the story! A young college kid finds out he is chosen to fight beings from another planet to save earth from being over run and conquered by the aforementioned beings(Ferox). 

The boy is Jonathan Tibbs your typical book worm early twenties college kid.  He is approached by a strange man who seemingly attacks him in his home but really is installing a device in him that activates once a ferox enters earths realm and gives him super strength that feeds off what he already is.

There's a big catch though and I won't spoil it incase anybody sees this and wants to read the book but he courageously alienates his friends and family and turns himself into a weapon to save humanity. 

There's a ton of twist and turns along the way. T.Ellery Hodge tells a beautiful story about an unassuming boy becoming a man and battling his inner self all along the way.

I have to say, I just don't get it with this author. It's like he wants to be a Vonnegut type, but everything he writes smacks of trying too hard. The characters are thin, the jokes are generally not very funny, a lot of the text just seems like something he wanted to write about that's not at all related to the plot. It's like faux-gonzo style, but without substance. Maybe he's just not for me. I will try again with *Jitterbug Perfume,* but I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth it. It seems like the type of book I may have enjoyed more in my twenties, but it's very much a poor man's Douglas Adams or something along those lines, at least that's the impression I get. I love writers like Vonnegut, Murakami, Huxley, Burroughs, Bukowksi, HST, Marquez, and other surrealist/magical realist types, but I feel like I'm missing something with this guy. Maybe he was a product of zeitgeist and simply isn't relevant anymore. Someone convince me otherwise, I am open-minded about this and will pursue further if it's worthwhile.",0

There's an author. She's not my favorite author, but she writes solid books with good plots and fantastic dialogue. Really excellent.

Thing is, she just started a spin-off series from her main series. One of the bad guys from the main series is now the protagonist. And I was like... but the things he did in the book are sadistic and unforgiveable, how is he the protagonist now? But whatever, I'll try to give it a chance, I guess?

I start reading it and he gets given a blanket absolution, oh, all the terrible things he did was someone else's fault, there was magic involved, now that magic is gone and left to his own devices he'll be way less evil. Okay, whatever. A little hand-wavy, not sure why you needed to make a story about this guy and then whitewash his past, there were plenty of other dark anti-heroes you could have made the star, but you went with this guy. Fine.

I'm about a third of the way through the book and I can't go any farther. He just got way, way too rapey. This was my first red flag when I first learned he was getting his own book; I've got nothing against dark situations, there's a lot of murder and death in these books, people struggling with how much they love to fight, but this guy always stood out cuz he was creepy af. He got actual sexual thrill from combat, and was frequently shown objectifying women. It was almost enough that I wasn't gonna give the book a chance, at all.

Early in the book, to my pleasant surprise, he notices a woman noticing him, approaches and flirts with her, is given a solid no, and he simply moves on. I was like, okay. I'm not cool with how you were in the past, but whatever. I guess you're just magically someone else now.

This proved to be wishful thinking. I don't wanna spoil anything just in case, but about a third of the way through the book there's a tense argument scene and he seamlessly slips into fantasizing about raping the woman he's arguing with. I sucked it up and read exactly two more paragraphs to see if some explanation came up, if it was some throwback from his past and he was going to react with revulsion to his own dark impulses, if they were going to acknowledge at all that this was a bad idea... nope. Totally natural. Our hero, ladies and gentlemen. Getting hard thinking about how delicious it will be when she tries to fight him off.

I get that the author was going for ""anti-hero."" I'm not unaware of the attempt. But no. Someone at some level in the proof-reading process should have told her that this is not how you anti-hero. Honestly someone should have told her that she burned her bridge with him as a bad guy and not to even try, but literally everyone from her beta readers to her editors who read the rape-fantasy scene and told her ""good job"" failed her.

Maybe I'm over-reacting. Maybe I should have just trusted my instincts and never read this book at all. I feel like now I can't even go back to the main series and re-read it. No part of this is okay at all. Maybe I'm just not dark enough, maybe the problem is with me, but I can't empathize with a main character who thinks it's a good thing to fantasize about rape.",0

Do you read a lot of reviews before picking a book? After reading it? Do you do book clubs? Are you a celebrity reviewer?

“Characters Victor: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

Martin’s development of the main character Dunk as an imperfect protagonist wins this category. Before reading the book, I though Dunk and Egg as names for the main characters might make Martin’s whole story a joke. Luckily, I was wrong. Dunk’s attempts to do his best in the world make for better character development than the almost all-powerful Geralt of Rivia. The Last Wish is supposed to be an introduction to Geralt, which it does serve for the basics that Geralt is a Witcher. He’s dangerous, imperfect, and he tries to do his best in the world, but this doesn’t compare to the growth we’re able to enjoy in Dunk’s and Egg’s adventures. The humor Sapkowski places into The Last Wish does add significantly to it and is one of the main reasons I enjoy the stories of Geralt so much.
Plot Victor: A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.

Martin’s stories provide a better arc to enjoy than Sapkowski’s disjointed and unconnected stories. While Martin has three longer stories, Sapkowski’s is a collection of six stories with a frame story that’s utilized between each of the six stories. A collection of short stories is fine to be disjointed, but the opportunity to use the frame to help the reader wasn’t utilized to its full potential and that penalizes Sapkowski in my review. Sapkowski’s challenge to write about the one main character that needs to fit in the rest of stories is more difficult. Meanwhile, Martin’s characters are never seen again in his books. Additionally, The Last Wish was written before most of Sapkowski’s other works, likely before he could have known the entire saga he was about to write.
Connections Victor: The Last Wish.

Sapskowski paints the scenes for some of the fundamental lore for the rest of his books and CDPR’s games. In comparison, Martin throws a lot of lineage at the reader and not much else in significant connections. The lightbulb moments that went off for me while reading The Last Wish were substantial and I don’t see even a thoroughly knowledgeable fan of Martin’s world to feel nearly the satisfaction of revelations that Sapkowski provided.

...

Final Verdict: If you’ve never read, watched, or played any media in either writer’s worlds, read The Knight of the Seven Kingdoms. It’ll provide a short, fun, and satisfying read. Plus there are some illustrations to enjoy throughout the book. “

I feel as if this book was written first, or even another book set within the world that Miller crafted, we would have a while series crafted in this fictional universe. Because that is exactly what Miller created, a *universe*. A world where knowledge is sacred and is used for evil and for good. It is sad that we will never see that world again. And it makes me sad every time I see it on my shelf. I'd love to dive into a post apocalypse that started back at 0 that was driven by the church. 

To anyone who had read the original, I highly suggest the sequel. It took me three times to actually get through it. Mostly due to having to stop and search things up as it deals heavily with how the church works, monks work and nomadic culture. Fictional or not. ",0

42,"For those who have trouble reading and think reading isnt for them. jUST KEEP READING!TL;DR: took me 15 years to ""learn how to read"" and my advice to people who have trouble reading.

1. Read out loud


2. Read slowly

3.reread a page or chapter as much as you need to.


4. Keep reading even if its not making sense or you aren't retaining it.


5. Try audible it's not cheating. 

I'm 33 years old and I hadn't read a single book (aside from a DMV handbook) in 15 years since I had left highschool. My excuse was always ""I can't retain anything"" and it was true. I could read a whole page and be into what I was reading and as soon as I was done with the page I had already forgot what I had read. I just keep telling myself reading isn't for me. And I went 15 years without reading a book. 

Then one day I kept hearing about this new book and how amazing it was! I knew I couldn't read it but I had to know the story so I broke and got myself and audible account. I bought the book and loved it! All of a sudden I wanted more! I wanted to listen to another book but they aren't cheap on audible and I couldn't wait a whole month for my next credit. I went down to my local thrift store and they had books for just ¢.75! I grabbed one and took it home. I immediately ran into the same problem as before I couldn't retain anything and it nearly broke me. But then I thought to myself why can you listen to a book but not read it? So what I did is I decided to read it outloud to myself as if I was listening to it in audible and that helped a bit.

After finding out that reading out loud worked for me I also realized that reading very slowly also helped. I was finally able to make progress on my book. I did have to go back and re-read a few chapters a few times just to make sure I truly retained what I had just read. Another thing I found out that worked for me was pushing through with any book that I picked up. No matter how stupid I felt not understanding what was going on or even if I didn't understand certain words. I realized that just reading on that a lot of it would just come together and make sense. And after getting through difficult books later on other books would seem like a breeze. 

A year and a half and 20 books later I no longer have to read out loud or very slowly. I just pick up a book and read it. Reading is for me now and I love it. It's my biggest pastime and I'm glad I stuck with it!

This book focuses on family, and the details behind how a small, lucky group of people could survive on what remains of a country entirely decimated by a disease. Great character development throughout, and the well developed and interesting characters far out shadow the less interesting ones. I would recommend this to anybody for a light, easy, and fun read.

48,"Discussion: Severance, by Ling MaI finished this book a couple of days ago, has anyone else read it?

I thought it was an interesting take on a sub-genre I am starting to feel myself drift away from (dystopian). I liked how, despite the bleakness of the world in the wake of Shen Fever, Candace steels herself from the reality of what that means for the future.

I walk away from the novel viewing it almost as a sort of love letter to urban life. Candace refuses to leave NYC even though everyone else already has. She is critical of her city (mentioning how expensive it is, recognizes that everyone has an idealistic view of the idea of NYC and includes herself in that group), but she also finds supreme comfort in all of its faults. She seems to have a very neutral look at the city - it's home to her despite how impersonal it is, how unequivocally indifferent it is to each citizen's personal life. The book seems almost like an appreciative love-letter towards urban life in general.

I really enjoyed Ling Ma's writing. I found the way she writes about millennial ennui to be very realistic, without being obnoxiously 'alt-lit' about it. The way Candace thinks of her parents is endearing, even if she is honest about their flaws.",0

In a time where most of us live far away from nature and rather independent of if, this book offers (in my opinion) an honest, loving and critical view of people having this close relationship with nature.

Like when I'm reading a book by myself, I feel like a lot of the symbolism and historical context goes flying over my head, but then if I was reading it for a class, we'd go over those things the next day, and learned a lot.  I don't think I would've enjoyed Shakespeare at all if it wasn't for my teacher pointing out all the jokes and allusions, and even for the books that I did enjoy by myself, like ""Crime and Punishment"", school provided a lot of extra depth, and historical facts about the time Dostoevsky was writing about that I didn't know myself. Now that I've graduated, how do I get this experience on my own? Should I buy editions of books that have a lot of footnotes and critical analyses at the end to get the same experience? Recently after reading ""Lord of the Flies"", I looked up analyses of it online, but most of the sources were from like Shmoop or Cliffsnotes.

55,"After being ""afraid"" of reading it for a long time, just finished American Psycho - I have a lot of thoughts I'd like to discussHey /r/books 

I have always wanted to read American Psycho, as satire tends to be my favorite type of novel, but was always a little nervous about how violent the book is supposed to be, so I avoided it.

Last week I saw an old interview with Mary Harron and Bret Easton Ellis where Harron jokes about how the novel only has about six pages of violence in it, so I thought what the hell and gave it a shot.

Just finished it today, and I'm glad I read it. I really enjoyed the writing style, and Bateman's narration has really stuck with me the last few days as I was reading. I was able to pretty easily skip some of the more disgusting parts of the novel without missing much, and Harron was right, there isn't THAT much violence in the book, as it seems to come in short, ridiculously over the top, bursts.

The book was honestly pretty hilarious, and I enjoyed the biting commentary. Every time he randomly interjected with what had been featured on The Patty Winters Show, or talk about his Platinum AmEx I would often laugh out loud. 

If anything, I feel like the book could have been maybe 50-100 pages shorter. While I loved the repetitive ramblings about fashion or restaurants or music, it went just past the point of enjoyable into skimmable toward the end.

I think my biggest question is, why did BEE write such violent scenes into a novel that I think otherwise got its points across pretty successfully?

56,"I want to discuss the ending of Slaughterhouse 5.I just finished Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut last night and I really enjoyed it. The whole book I was totally willing to suspend disbelief that Billy was kidnapped by aliens. Why? Because that's just the way it is. I liked that about the book that it was very matter of fact about aliens and time travel.

Right near the end, Billy is in a book store and finds a copy of a book by his friend, Kilgore Trout, in which the main character is also kidnapped by aliens and put in a zoo. He thought he hadn't read it at first but then he remembers that he did read it long ago. This really interested me and also threw me because I'm not sure the point of Vonnegut putting this in the book. To me it seems like this is a reveal that Billy wasn't really kidnapped by aliens, but he made it up. Perhaps when he was in the hospital with a brain injury, he remembered parts of his friends book and constructed memories that it happened to him. But this isn't even really addressed. Also, the book he finds is a little different because it starts talking about the kidnappers being put into some stock-market experiment. Another possibility is that Kilgore wrote this book afterward based on Billy's experience but I don't think it said anything about that either.

I think it's purposefully open-ended, but I'm just curious if anyone else read into that and what they got out of it.",0
57,"Why ""Munmun"" is the most uniquely written and intriguing YA book I've read in a long time(Only mild spoilers in this post but I flaired it like that just in case)

Yesterday I finished a book titled ""Munmun"" recommended to our class by the local teen librarian.  She does book talks twice a year and usually I love every book she recommends so of course I decided to check this out.

I knew right away from reading the book jacket it would be an interesting read.

Because this book is largely a commentary on wealth inequality and capitalism is written from the perspective of an extremely poor and illiterate person, it is also written in the tone of an illiterate person.  Forexample, alot of short phrases are cominbed, sentences are very runon, things ramble, jumpy and see what I mean?  This style takes a lot of getting used to, but is so beautifully and consistently done that it pulls you even deeper into the world of the book.  The only other book that's even come close to doing something this unique was ""Ivory and Bone"" which was written almost entirely in 2nd person. 

As far as the actually story, the book jacket and online basic summaries are also a little mislrading.  They portray it as a story about a littlepoor brother and sister working to get our of their impoverished state.  You would imagine the climax then to be their success and for a happy ended.  Rather, their success comes about 1/3 of the way through the book (sort of, it's a complicated book, you should read it to understand it more fully).  The book is more about the main character Warner struggling with the economic and social systems present in the book regardless of what scale he's at (scale is the book's representation of weath.  The more munmuns you have, the larger you physically are and the bigger your scale).  It's a beautiful commentary/satire, beautiful story, and the most unique read I've had in a very long time.

66,"East of Eden Support Group#s 
I just finished East of Eden then watched the film. Now I have a strong urge to write the director and ask him what we did to deserve such an atrocity. How can such a complex book with such diverse characters be cut so short? 

Raise your hand if you've been personally victimized by Elia Kazan and James Dean. 

No Lee! No Sam Hamilton! No context with regards to Adam or Cate which inadvertently shaped who they were as people and as parents.

I understand books have to be adapted to film and some things don't translate well but there were a few parts of the novel I was shocked didn't make the cut. Given that the film only covers the 4th part of the book - the real travesty - I figured less deviations would take place. 

For example, I was disappointed that Cal and Adam didn't have a genuine father - son conversation. It's a pivotal point in the book as Adam finally realizes that he isn't any better of a father than his own. He then makes a choice to be a better Father and recognize Cal as not only his son, but a person. In one conversation Adam realizes he wants to know his sons and Cal realizes he loves his father. It was wholesome and I was sad to see it cut but the movie did try and make up for what it lacked.

In the book Steinbeck meticulously crafted his characters but since the movie skipped the first 500 pages it was necessary to create a few scenes. Doing this gave the audience some context of who the characters were and who they wished to be. 

I think the scene with the German neighbor did just this and added a lot to the movie that viewers needed in order to understand the boys characters. In it Aron protected his neighbor as he couldn't understand or accept that people could be so cruel and unjust. Cal jumped out of a ferris wheel to protect his brother because he thought it was good and his guilt guided him. However, Aron chastised Cal for doing this because it was self indulgent of Cal. That rejection made Cal 'bad' which Abra was attracted to because it meant she didn't have to live up to Arons seemingly pretentious 'goodness' which was another rejection, only towards Aron, not Cal. So much in one scene.

If only people watching the movie knew how similar Adam was to Aron. Adam, in his naivety, refused to see bad (specifically in Kate which his talks about with Lee and Sam) but Aron refused to accept bad and it's existence hurt him. However, with age Adam began to see the bad and he felt guiltily for loving Kate. This changed him and he couldn't accept Cals money - surprise, another rejection.

Another part the movie messed up was how Cal saw Cathy. He knew she was missing the ability to see good just as Adam did when he brought her Charles's letter. My mouth fell open when Kate gave Cal money instead of Lee. It was against everything she was because she hated Cal. He saw her insecurities, her fear, her inability to believe people can be good and she hated it.

67,"I just finished Foundryside by Robert Jackson Bennett, and I'm consistently floored by how this author can always bring out such a deep gut reaction to the stories and themes of his books.I first discovered Bennett years ago when my local bookstore had a copy of American Elsewhere on display. I was intrigued by the cover and I love small town horror so I decided to give it a shot. The result was a fantastic romp with a little sci fi, a little horror, a sprinkle of Lovecraftian atmosphere mixed with fantastic writing and characters.

I immediately went out and picked out his other books at the time and enjoyed them to various degrees, especially loving The Troupe which felt like a slightly more grown up version of Something Wicked This Way Comes. The book had me heartbroken again, and was full of some gorgeous and haunting imagery, easily being his most Lovecraftian story.

And then City of Stairs came out and I was skeptical about the change from horror to fantasy, but I eventually gave it a shot and all doubt vanished. The world was wonderfully built and incredibly unique. Seeing the world recovering from the war against the gods, seeing the aftermath of what would usually be the main event was refreshing, while the conflicts and morality presented in the story made it so much more powerful than most modern fantasy. And each book continued this story, making a factastic, dark Trilogy mixed with horror, drama, mystery, and romance on top this amazing fantasy world, along with three main characters who are all incredibly compelling and unique.

Now having finished Foundryside, I'm convinced this is a fantasy author destined to be one of the greats. The magic system gave me major Brandon Sanderson vibes, the action was brutal, the mystery was fantastic, and in the end I felt such pain for the characters and their struggles.

84,"Slightly let down by ""The Sirens of Titan""I just finished ""The Sirens of Titan"" a few minutes ago. I wasn't expecting it to end so suddenly - I guess it feels something like walking down a staircase and expecting there to be just one more step. But all I got was a really hard stomp on the ground where it should've kept going. 

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the story and I loved Vonnegut's poetic narration style. I just feel like the grand message of the book - that the supposed meaninglessness of human civilization for some higher power's ends doesn't take away from the lives that everyone led along the way - isn't a terribly new or life-changing thought (for me). Maybe it's that his ""loving whoever is around to be loved"" message doesn't resonate too well with me, either. I don't know. 

The biblical satire was interesting, but I was always grasping for more - for something deeper, that I could sink my teeth into and wrestle with. Maybe I'm just missing the point and that it can be ""whatever you like, because nothing matters anyway."" ",0
85,"How do you read books in a series?I have so many series where I read the first book in the series, but then forget what happened in that book by the time the next book in the series comes out a year later. I’ve started just waiting for all of the books in a series to come out before reading any of the books in it. This works pretty well for trilogies, but not so well for those series with like eight books in it. (And series with an indefinite number of books are the worst.) 

Do you tend to read books in series as they are released, or wait until all of the books are out? If you read the books as they are released, do you reread the previous books in a series before the next book comes out? I always have the best intention of rereading books, but this always seems to get pushed to the side in favor of books I haven’t read yet. ",0

90,"Review Notes - Alhazred: Author of the Necronomicon by Donad TysonDonald Tyson’s Alhazred straddles the line between addition to the Lovecraftian mythos and fan fiction. With this in mind, the story is very well done. In the 660-page tome, Tyson offers his version of the biography of Lovecraft’s legendary Abdul Alhazred, the author of the Necronomicon frequently referenced in the mythos. Late in the text Tyson separates the two names when the title character reveals his name to be Alhazred, but that it had previously been Abdul. This explanation is essential in my view, since the original Lovecraftian name is grammatically incorrect.

The story begins quickly. By the end of the first chapter the main character is mutilated, made a eunuch, forced to consume his own genitals. As the story proceeds he meets various spirits, demons, sorceresses, ghouls, and Cthulhu spawn as he seeks magical knowledge and the power to restore his lost manhood. The story in many ways follows the pattern of mythical coming of age stories for both Alhazred and his young female companion. Here are a few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the book:

•	Early in the story Alhazred is marked with the sign of the outer god Nyalarthotep, a notably dishonorable diety who disdains the other outer gods. While the sign grants him safe passage in many cases, many of the characters in the story recognize it as a kind of brand, marking him as the god’s slave. As a result they are distrustful of Alhazred as they are of Nyalarthotep.

•	Following his banishment to the desert Alhazred joins a clan of ghouls, eventually being accepted by them. It’s at this point that he develops the first and strongest friendship of his life with a ghoul who has himself been banished. The friendship creates lasting change in Alhazred, leading him to embrace his new identity.

•	May of the longest-lived, most intelligent characters in the novel often have only one critical piece of wisdom or knowledge, but turn out to be tricksters or fools in every other way.

•	Chapter 52 is one of the strangest pieces of fiction I’ve ever read.  The book is worth reading just for that chapter.

•	The story begins with Alhazred’s manhood being torn from him by a king, and he fully recovers himself by defeating another king. In the process of seeking the power to restore his manhood, he discovers a more powerful and free version of himself.

The novel is broken into two parts of approximately equal length. The first part describes Alhazred’s journey through the desert of Yemen, across the Red Sea, and up the Nile. The second part details the trek of he and his female companion into Mesopotamia and finally Damascus. The storytelling in part one is well focused. Part two has less focus in the narrative; it can be better described as a series of vignettes and adventures. Tyson incorporates plot twists throughout the novel, but some come off as gimmicks rather than solid storytelling. I found Alhazred to be a fun read, though it only scratches the surface of the Lovecraft mythos. It also contains themes of hope and agency that aren’t found in Lovecraft’s work. I’d recommend this book to folks who are interested in occult fiction, Lovecraft-inspired fiction and the Cthulhu mythos, or weird fantasy in general.

91,"Convince me to continue reading Moby Dick by Herman MelvilleI am about 100 pages into this 430 page copy. This book puts me to sleep faster than any book I’ve ever tried to read. There are chapter-long asides of Ishmael just discussing...whatever he feels like? It’s like some intellectual just thinking to himself and it’s dull. There are incredible amounts of references to people or events that were surely important during that time, but they go straight over my head. That’s usually fine if it’s a few here and there, but I am not understanding a great deal of what I’m reading because of it. 

Anything with dialogue has been fine, but there is so little of it so far. Captain Ahab has been introduced, but I have yet to hear him speak. Queequeg is a somewhat funny and quirky character. 

Does it get much better? I would really like to know the full story, but if it is this dull throughout I will honestly read the Sparks Notes instead. That would probably help me make sense of what I’m reading too. I want to enjoy what I’m reading and this is feeling like a chore. ",0

My recall is fine, say for instance someone says to me ""I read the morale landscape"" I can say oh me too! I can't generate the conversation from the start but if I'm giving a topic from within the book, it's like my brain goes ""Oh yah I remember that now."" But otherwise, it might as well be as if I never read the book. It's incredibly frustrating for me and kind of takes the wind out of my sales and discourages me from picking up other books to read. I feel as if I come away reading books with lessons that I internalize, and I keep those lessons with me. But I can barely remember any specific content from which I learned this lesson I've now internalized. I'm concerned that this often times leads me to an ""illusion of competence"" of sorts.

116,"The Stand vs. Swan SongLet me start by saying I love post-apocalyptic fiction, the concept frightens me but I just eat it up in all it's mediums. Know this a friend recommended Robert McCammon's 1987 novel *Swan Song* giving me a brief synopsis as well. Admittedly I was turned off as it sounded like a less interesting ripoff of Stephen King's apocalyptic epic *The Stand*.

​

But after being unable to settle on a new book to start, I picked *Swan Song* up albeit skeptical of the product. Boy was I wrong. I couldn't put the damn thing down and despite it's size finished it off in a few weeks. Yes, it shares some thematic and conceptual elements of *The Stand* but that's where the similarities really stop. I have to admit I lean towards liking McCammon's work better.

​

Both stories have an apocalyptic event kick starting an epic battle of good and evil in the ruins of America. While I enjoyed the superflu aspect in *The Stand's* first half, McCammon really captures the devastation, confusion, and fear that comes with nuclear war. McCammon's post-disaster villain ""The Man with the Scarlet Eye"" also comes off more menacing than Randall Flagg because he's almost a Lovecraftian unspeakably horrific entity. Whereas *The Stand* establishes the main conflict as a battle in a Judeo-Christian religious terms, *Swan Song* sets it in more magical and mysterious tones.   I'd also give points to the characters of *Swan Song* who by the end I was really rooting for and understood even if they were villainous.

Like ""obviously we know its a girl, but we say he anyway."" 

Moon Called seemed promising, but it was oddly misogynistic and had a girl going back to a man who was just using her (or that's where it looked like it was going when I stopped reading.

124,"Review Notes - The Face in the Abyss by A MerrittAbraham Merritt’s “The Face in the Abyss” was one of the most heavily read and reprinted novels of the pulp era. As is true for many authors who were successful in the pulp fiction industry Merritt’s plots and charac-ters were often formulaic. However, Merritt integrated enough unique premises and ideas to make each of his works unique and entertaining.

The most heavily printed version of the story includes the original novelette plus the concluding sequel, The Snake Mother. However, because the story was reprinted so many times several differing versions can be found in pulp magazines and books emerging from 1930 through 1980, with introductory chapters being the most frequent addition to the story.

The hero and main character of The Face in the Abyss, Nicholas Graydon, is in many ways a stock character of the pulp era. A reasonably well edu-cated white American male, thirsty for adventure and wealth, quick tempered, physically courageous though possessing a simplistic conscience, and of course having a strong attraction to young women.

The story opens with Graydon, a mining engineer, being recruited by three treasure hunters to seek Incan treasure. One of the treasure hunters takes a young Incan woman hostage. He attempts to assault her but is stopped by Graydon, who sets the young woman free. The others return and become incensed that what the girl, whom they saw as a ticket to fabulous wealth, was freed. They disarm Graydon of his “automatic” and make him a prisoner during their search for treasure. The woman eventually returns with others from her society, and in a twist, leads the men to a hidden city where they find a trove of gold and jewels. However, the horde of wealth turns out to be under the control of an apparitional dark lord called Namir. The rest of the novel centers on Graydon’s recruitment into a battle against Namir and his allies. A few thoughts and reflections I had while reading the novel are below:

•	While many pulp-era stories contain unabashed casual racism and sexism, it’s not blatantly on display in the Face in the Abyss. In fact, one of the strongest leaders in the story, the Snake Mother, is female.

•	In the story the overriding desire for money and wealth is used to bring characters to destruction, while motivations like love or knowledge lead to salvation.

•	In one of the most interesting chapters of the novel the Snake Mother discusses the similarities between those who are cer-tain there is extraterrestrial life and those who are certain there is life after death. She points out that both sets of believers have powerful arguments but no evidence, and the irony that they often reject each oth-er’s arguments. In this respect not much has changed since 1930.

•	The name of the ancient city in the story, Yu-Atlanchi, sounds too similar to New Atlantis to be coincidence.

The Face in the Abyss is a fun read, and gives the reader a few interesting tidbits to think about. Just as importantly, it gives the reader a window into the mindset of many males in 1920s America. Paper copies are easily found and dirt cheap, and the novel is freely published by project Guttenberg Australia:

125,"Anyone looking forward to Small Fry by Lisa Brennan-Jobs (daughter of Steve Jobs) released today (9-4-2018) ?Really excited about this one, she seemed to have a very intriguing life situation. 

From what I have seen so far, she had a really fucked up situation growing up. Steve Jobs, while being a millionaire tech celebrity, denied that he was Lisa's father and she and her mother had to live off of welfare. When it was finally proved via DNA test that he was the father, he still denied it and in a Time magazine article said something like 10% of American men could be her father. 

From what I saw in the movies, he seemed to actively engage in gaslighting her Mom, threatening that he has people who can kill her in and instant and he could get away with it. This was only in the movie and not in Walter Issacson's book, but the people who worked on the movie did some very heavy research, even reaching out to Lisa herself, and pretty much everyone who knows Steve said that the movie was a very accurate representation of his character. 

Lisa's Mom seemed to have her own demons too. There wasn't too many details in this situation, but when she was a kid, there was an incident and she wanted to move out her Mom's house and into Steve's. 

Steve says he's remorseful for what he did. But it seems like things weren't happily ever after, and accepted her into her life (though the movie heavily implied that he didn't actually start paying decent child support until he found out she was actually a pretty intelligent person. That he may not have paid more if she seemed normal to him). They still seemed to have conflict, stemming from Lisa growing older and figuring out what Steve had done to her and her Mom. Steve at one point refused to pay Lisa's Harvard tuition. 

In the movie, both Joanna Hoffman and Andy Hertzfeld confronted Steve on the way he treated his daughter. At one point Andy tell's Steve on why he paid her tuition ""I think it's a miracle she's not robbing banks with the Symbionese Liberation Army. There's no reason in the world why she should be nice. But she is. So I helped, because somebody had to.""

126,"The Most Interesting Book Ever Written...... I'm pretty sure I've got this right - it took 30+ years of constant reading and a lot of polls and powerpoint presentations - and the answer is Joe McGiness' Fatal Vision.   
   
Now that the correct answer has been established, I am curious to hear others' thoughts on the matter. It was a mammoth bestseller in the 80's but then was taken out of print due to legal issues and, despite objectively being the Most Interesting Book Ever Written, is not often mentioned here or anywhere else. Why is this property not being snatched up by Netflix or whatever - is it not the ultimate true crime story? Can we get a running thread up about it, locked on the top of the subreddit page and updated constantly please mods?",0

129,"Just finished The Dark Tower series by Stephen King. My mind is absolutely blown.Wow. Just wow. I honestly thought that King would never reveal what is at the top of the tower, leaving it up to the reader's imagination. But nope- he only goes and pulls one of the biggest plot-twists of all.  

Some people will hate the fact that it's a loop, but I personally LOVED it. It makes Roland into a really tragic character, forced to relive the journey and pain and loss over and over again. However, there's some hope- Roland picks up the horn of Eld for the first time before chasing the Man in Black across the desert; perhaps he'll finally be able to see what's at the top of the Tower?  

I also loved the references placed throughout the books to other King novels and the Meta stuff with King himself and his accident... basically this series worked really well for me. Plus, a lot was left to the reader's interpretation; for example, I kinda think that Mordred is somehow related to Pennywise (for both of them, their closest thing to a true form is a spider) and that Susannah actually went to the afterlife, not New York (the main giveaway was that she forgets everything, like Jake and Eddie have, and that Jake is now Eddies little brother.  

Anyway, what did you all think of the ending and the books in general? I know some really dislike the last 3, but I really enjoyed them (Song of Susannah wasn't as good as the rest though).",0

And I'm about two-thirds through ""Paul Clifford"" (which begins: ""It was a dark and stormy night."")  I don't mind these books at all, and I'll have a go at ""The Coming Race"".  It seems to me that Lytton has become so much a figure of fun (Bulwer-Lytton contest, for example), that hardly anybody reads his books.

I've even read ""Z"", ""So We Read On"" and other texts about Scott's personal life. 

""Tender Is The Night"" is my white whale. I've started it once, and got bored. Years later I started the audiobook, but wasn't feeling it. Now, a couple years later, I'm determined to start and finish it. 

This is not an uncommon relationship with me and Scott's works. I've also never finished ""Beautiful &amp; the Damned"" and ""Love of the Last Tycoon""—even though both seemed very interesting to me. So why am I so deadset on getting through TITN? I feel like there's a masterpiece buried beneath its pages and I just need to get through it and will be rewarded.

So... The first plot hole is a big one: 

[Spoiler and Divergent Plot Hole](#s ""The fear landscape is tailored to force Dauntless to face their own individual fears, so how come in Tris's landscape for her final evaluation she doesn't have to face being caught as a Divergent? Wouldn't that be a massive and important fear of hers? At this point she already knows that Divergents are being hunted, and she knows that Erudite are plotting a war. Shouldn't her fear landscape be an instant giveaway?"")

And then there is this simple inconsistency:

[Spoiler and Insurgent Inconsistency](#s ""In Divergent it is explained that Four's mother died in childbirth isn't it? But in Insurgent, on page 12, Tris speaks of Four when she says 'He lost his mother when he was young. I don't remember how she dies, just that we attended her funeral'. So... what's up with that?"") 

Sorry if the spoiler tags didn't work. I am new to reddit and using mobile. 

Anyone care to discuss these two things? 

EDIT: The spoiler tags lead to a blank page so I am explaining them here. SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON: 

1- The fear landscape is tailored to force Dauntless to face their own individual fears, so how come in Tris's landscape for her final evaluation she doesn't have to face being caught as a Divergent? Wouldn't that be a massive and important fear of hers? At this point she already knows that Divergents are being hunted, and she knows that Erudite are plotting a war. Shouldn't her fear landscape be an instant giveaway?

And then there is this simple inconsistency:

2- In Divergent it is explained that Four's mother died in childbirth isn't it? But in Insurgent, on page 12, Tris speaks of Four when she says 'He lost his mother when he was young. I don't remember how she dies, just that we attended her funeral'. So... what's up with that?

The only books in the past year that I have read on my own are books by Haruki Murakami just because they mean a lot to me and have amazing stories.

Anyways, I'm starting to read some biographies on my own just to learn about more figures that are important to me, in this instance J Dilla.

I'm just worried that when I finish the book that I will forget all of the important material about him and other people I'm reading on.

143,"The beyonders series by Brandon Mull was surprisingly wonderful.I bought book 1 at Dollar Tree for a dollar to read to my daughter.  I wound up reading ahead finishing it and ordering the last two books online.  All three books are pretty straight forward no major surprises but the story is incredibly good and sucks you in. 

Two young teen whom are complete strangers get sucked into another realm called Lyrian which is under the oppressive rule of the last wizard Maldor. 

They are tasked with completing a quest no hero of this foreign world has, finding the word to destroy Maldor.

It's laid out much like a video game,  each chapter another step in the quest. 

Mull has two very well put together main protagonist and a wonderful supporting cast.

At first I thought I would hate it, but found it fun save for a few boring parts. The whole thing felt like an adventure, filled with twists and turns. What I'm wondering is if I missed something from the original version, as I read one of the abridged books. I'm asking this because, some storylines felt incomplete, and in seeing some of the discussions about Monte Cristo, they might have been complete on the original version? For example, the relationship between the Count and Haydee didn't at all feel real. It seemed more like an abusive relationship with Haydee claiming she was as happy as can be despite being a slave, (I understand that he tried to free her, but in the abridged version at least I didn't see their interactions ad positives). At the end of the book it also says that Valentine loves Haydee as a sister, which really confused me considering that neither of them met each other before. I'm not sure if I just blanked out in these parts, or if the abridged version I read was just missing important information, but it did feel incomplete.

160,"Wonky Realities in Adult BooksI'm interested in what you all think of abstract characters or realities in non-children books. I remember my childhood riddled with characters like Willy Wonka or realities such as that found in *The Phantom Tollbooth*. These places and characters were just straight goofy or other-worldly and left a mark that I still remember years later. Thinking back on all the books I've read as an adult, there are so few that contain this sort of magical element. The few that I can think of off the top of my head are mostly created by Steven Erickson, with characters such as Tehol Beddict, Bugg, Iskral Pust, and quite a number of minor characters from his *Malazan Book of the Fallen*. This of course can be attributed to being placed in a fantasy that doesn't take itself too seriously all the time. The only book somewhat grounded in reality that doubles down on a kook I've read is *An Evening of Long Goodbyes* by Paul Murray which has the main character a caricature of a young and wealthy elite who is thrown into the common man's reality head first. The first half of the book shines the brightest though as the protagonist has yet to see the real world and has complete efficacy of his surroundings; reading his perspective of mundane things is hilarious. But why is this so rare? Do books targeted at adults take themselves too seriously? Why do books fall behind in playing with our surreal  imagination relative to other forms of media?

Large chunks of it are just one character (mostly the librarian) monologue-ing about ancient Sumerian culture and then a short break for cyberpunk and then back to the history lesson. 

It feels like Stephenson wanted to write a research paper on ancient Sumerian culture, religion, language, and how they relate to each other but didn't think anyone would buy it. Like two gears spinning together, the Sumerian and cyberpunk stuff mesh but remain totally independent, meaning the transfer back and forth is somewhat jarring. ",0

Despite the first book having been published in 2002, it gives great insight into the potential future and longevity of drug cartels. The second book goes on to show just how much power and financial growth the cartels can really have. Examples of this range from cloning, political influence and control to environmental experiments and the border control.

In a way the books serve as a warning, to not allow these things to come to fruition (as fictional as some themes may seem). The conclusion of Lord of Opium ends on an optimistic note as Mateo finally takes full command of his nation of Opium in hopes to lead it into a brighter future than what El Patron had. 

During my re-reading I began to realize how some of these topics are what intrigue people into watching shows like Narcos, Queen of the South, El Chapo, El Señor de los Cielos, and even Breaking Bad. Consequentially I have tried to convince some of my friends to to read these books as I believe they'll really enjoy them. However most of my friends won't pick up the books. 
Do you all believe these books would make a good Netflix series? I don't believe they'd make good movies and a good part of the messages from the books would be lost in translation but a series could do them justice. What do you all think? Have you read the books? Would you read them if you haven't already done so?",0
168,"What are your thoughts on 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee?I recently finished the book for a reading assignment and I was astounded by the sheer brilliance of the book. I really feel like the author is trying to pass down a message to us readers, as if there is a point to telling to story other than pure enjoyment. When you break it down, every chapter ends up having a little story to tell. Characters are nuanced, with depth and care ingrained in each action and speech. Suspense and tension are handled exceptionally well, especially in the court case. What an amazing read.

Truly, a book I will hold close to my heart.",0
169,"Review Notes - In the Shadow of the Banyan by Vaddey RatnerIn the Shadow of the Banyan is part memoir, part autobiographical novel of Vaddey Ratner, the daughter of a Cambodian Prince. It tells the story of her survival through the years of the communist revolution and subsequent genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge. While it's written in the first person from the perspective of a five to eight year old child, Vaddey uses the medium to work through her adult thoughts, feelings, and perspectives by placing them into the mind of her main character. A few thoughts I had while reading through the novel:

* The first chapter gives an clear description of her rather sheltered, seemingly innocent life as a member of a royal family. Her father, who works as an intellectual and a poet, seems to carry his own innocence, or perhaps naivete about the society in which he lives
* &gt;!The family's innocence is shattered by the middle of the second chapter!&lt;
* As the family flees fighting in the city and enters the countryside, with revolutionary soldiers as guides one begins to get the feeling that the entire battle for the city and refugee crisis was staged by the Khmer Rouge. The population, particularly the upper class population was tricked into moving into rural camps where they could by physically imprisoned, surveilled, and moved around with ease. 
* It's not for several months before the characters realize they won't be able to return home, and accept the reality of that situation. This meshes with the refugee experiences of other works I have read, notably ""Nobody Waiting"". It seems many people are susceptible to a belief that returning home (possibly returning to youth and perceived safety) is always possible. Even at the end of the story the girl needs to be reminded that there is no home to return to.
* Class consciousness is tied into the novel, as one would expect of a tale that dealing with communism and royalty. And it seems that lack of class mobility reduced the ability of the characters to adapt as the traditional systems by which they had defined themselves were demolished. &gt;!The most adaptable character in the story was the mother, and she had lived as a poor farmer, a villager, and a wife to a prince. Because of this she had skills as diverse as gardening, sewing, the ability to speak French, understanding of literature, an ability to keep secrets, particularly within herself. It's this skill set that becomes more important to survival than all others.!&lt;
* &gt;!Vaddey reveals in the novel that her father had supported many of the ideals of the revolutionaries, but believed they should have worked through the democratic system that existed in Cambodia from 1970 to 1975. He states that he became disillusioned when the revolutionaries embraced authoritarianism and violence, as though their ends could justify any means. However, his response to their imminent threat was to condemn their methods in private conversation, not to demonstrate for democracy, prepare for fighting and survival, or to confront the threat in any meaningful way. Clearly he was not alone in this!&lt;; Cambodia's collapse into totalitarianism and racial genocide was the result of a massive collective error by millions of adult Cambodians, people whose very lives, and much of the meaning of their lives, depended on their social systems and structures. By failing to defend that system they became participants in their own doom.

I found the novel to be easy to read and though provoking.  Vaddey's descriptions are vivid, and her storytelling is powerful. I recommend it to anyone interested in a story of survival under terrifying conditions.",0
170,"Is this an author's mistake or something else? (Clockwork Angel by Cassandra Clare)I am at chapter five right now but I just can't figure one thing, why didn't Tessa shapeshift into one of Dark Sisters to solve the mystery surrounding her?

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a special reason that she can't do this or is it just for a plot? 

Keep in mind that I am still reading the book so please mark your spoliers. (rule number 7)",0
171,"Just finished reading Vargas Llosa's ""The bad girl"". That's a good way to show a toxic relationship. What you guys think about the book?Basically, the title.

I just read the book and I was constantly thinking ""well, I know what this guy goes through. I've had a toxic relationship in the past, but his situation is much worse"".

Although, I'm not sure the narrator is reliable. Bumping into the ""bad girl"" in different countries and showing her as a really bad person seems suspect.

Anyway, what you guys think of the book? ",0
172,"How do you read YA?First of all I'd like to say I used to be huuuugely into YA in my early twenties. I just loved the fast pace of the books (and still do!). But lately I've been trying to read some YA, and while I still really enjoy the pace of them, it's gotten almost impossible to suspend my disbelief.

&amp;#x200B;

I can believe that a teenage girl and boy fall in love crazily, but that they often defy (read: are allowed to defy) the whole 'system' of a society (dystopia), and that there are no consequences for their actions most of the time is so unrealistic it's very difficult not to be taken out of the story completely. Also, they're always so innocent and rarely kill because of MORAL HIGH GROUND, even when their life is in danger and they should really really be putting that bullet into that guy's skull (and would, in a realistic situation, when the author didn't want to keep them pure and innocent). The romances feel contrived (I seriously don't even know why most of them happen, and rarely YA does this well) and the 'danger' they're in is laughable and usually easily solved.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me, guys, am I reading bad YA, or is this just normal in YA? I'd hate to give up these books, because some of them are quite good (such as the first - and only the first - Divergent book and even the Hunger Games - also only book one) and some are even exceptional, but with the amount of fairy princess mary sue stuff that's out there, it's a hassle to find something like that.",0

175,"Anyone else doing the 2018 Goodreads annual challenge.https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/7501-2018-reading-challenge

I currently am and pledged 36. Felt real good myself and saw the average was 55. Though I'm struggling with depression, drinking myself to death, and a divorce, so reading only happens once in a blue moon at this point. But I power through a book in 2 days when I can. It's obviously a biased group, but seriously? Either way, big or small, how's your challenge going?",0
176,"The plot of Infinite Jest (IJ thread? IJ thread.)Hey guys, currently re-reading IJ for the first time. This was my first DFW ever, in the meantime I have read all of his non-fiction and some of his fiction, though I find Brief interviews to be a bit of a drag.

Anyway, obviously IJ doesn't arrive at a proper ending, or rather an ending that unfolds in an orthodox, chronological manner. I've read that DFW conceded in private (in a conversation with Jonathan Franzen IIRC) that there are some inconsistencies in the plot. Then again, I've also read that DFW sort of relies on the reader to make sense of it all; you're supposed to extrapolate from the narrative provided (and the footnotes obviously) and conclude the quest for the Samizdat and its development on your own.

I find myself much more interested in the atmosphere of the book than all the theories about putative events the reader is pretty much required to guess at. I love DFW's voice in this, and I love how he fleshed out this bizarre world. It really is an encyclopedic novel, in a way it's almost non-fiction, except of course the world is fictional.


So how do you feel about this, did you read it ""for the plot""? Or just for the feel? General Infinite Jest/IJ reread thread I guess.",0
177,"Which books that you were initially excited for, ultimately turned out to be disappointments?In general, it's common for readers to anticipate greatness from a book and find it unbearable or bland. Did you attempt to push through it, or did you disregard the book entirely?  


I suppose that my choice would be The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway. While some aspects of it are enjoyable, I found the majority of it to be tedious and uninteresting. ",0
178,"What series would be fun to read out of order?I'm on book 3 of Ursula Le. Guin's *Earthsea Cycle*, and while it may be a blasphemous thought, I got to thinking how interesting it would have been if I read the books going backwards.

With how the books are so far written - being loosely connected; each book is a separate story connected by the character Ged - the books could be read out of order without losing much cohesion. If anything, Ged would become a wise yet mysterious wizard who accompanies the other younger protagonist throughout their journey, helping to guide them; and then when you got to book 1, you would get the rewarding backstory to Ged. 

I think it would be really neat if I could erase my memory and re-read the series going from book 3 to 2 to 1.

Have you read any series that have made you think this before?",0
179,"This bit from Chuck Klosterman's The Visible Man (2001) poignantly describes many Internet denizensThat's what people do when they're sitting at a computer: They multitask and they daydream and they think about everything at once. One can easily fold obsessive self-absorption into the process of online communicating. In other words, the Internet was doing two things for Bruce - it allowed him to separate from the exterior life he hated, but also allowed him to stay engaged with an interior life he wanted. It was, ultimately, the single most important aspect of who he was: It removed his present-tense unhappiness while facilitating the prospect of future joy. It made the dark part of his mind smaller, but it made the optomistic part limitless. It added what he needed to affix and subtracted what he hoped to destroy. 

And maybe this was bad for Bruce's humanity, but I think it was probably good. I think it took a mostly sad man and made him mostly happy.",0
180,"What medium do you use to take notes from the books you read/study?I’ve never been a big reader in the past, just a few novels here and there. But I recently got into business books and I realized that they can be a great source of knowledge beyond just telling stories (which sounds obvious but somehow wasn’t for someone who used to get that knowledge mostly from documentaries on TV and YouTube). 

I started to take notes while reading as soon as I realized that I would forget everything otherwise. I use fineliner color pens and squared paper note cards. Handwriting is crucial for me to remember information.

Do you guys prefer pens and paper, an iPad with Evernote, maybe just a laptop with MS Word? ",0

182,"One Second AfterIf you are looking for a great read that is fiction, but also a cautionary tale for countries, check out One Second After by William R. Forstchen.

 An EMP has wiped out all electric and communications in the U.S. and people are struggling to survive. Newt Gingrich wrote the forward and explains that this is one of the attacks that our country (America) is least prepared for. 

This book really put things in perspective for me about what might happen if we ever faced this. We have such a strong military force, but if an electromagnetic pulse were set off over our country, we would be back to the dark ages very quickly. This author does an amazing job of describing the possible aftermath of an attack like this. ",0
183,"Desperation by Stephen KingI just finished reading this book after picking it up for $2 at a second hand shop.  I'd never heard of it before, but I thought I'd give it a look.

The first few chapters were really tense as a couple are pulled over by a strange cop on a desert highway.  From there, I found the tension dissipated a bit for the rest if the book and I noticed that the formula was similar to IT: 5 or 6 strangers being pitted against an ancient being whose only purpose seems to be to kill everything.  

I didn't mind this book, and I'm now curious to see the movie.",0

Or this passage from The Hours: “I remember one morning getting up at dawn. There was such a sense of possibility. You know, that feeling. And I... I remember thinking to myself: So this is the beginning of happiness, this is where it starts. And of course there will always be more...never occurred to me it wasn't the beginning. It was happiness. It was the moment, right then.”

187,"What's your stance on independent authors?When it comes to independent authors, do you typically try to stray away from them? 

Sometimes an indie author can be so professional in their approach (their writing and cover design) that it's not hard to tell the difference. But in the case that it's obvious someone is indie, would it make you less willing to read their work?

It's definitely interesting to see Jean Louise's internal struggle with finding out the nature of those who she loves the most, but Atticus's characterization is tough to swallow, and anything that excuses/advocates for discrimination is uncomfortable to read at this point.

I finally got around to reading it and I’m only about 100 pages in to it, but I love it. The story is beautifully written, and it’s leaving me with this magical feeling of awe and wonder, similar to the fantasy books I read as a child like The Chronicles of Narnia. I’ve realized that this is the feeling I miss reading now as an adult. Anyone else read this and have the same feelings, or any books you’ve read as an adult that have this effect on you? ",0
190,"I just read Chuck Palahniuk's "" Invisible Monsters"" and I think it was an amazing and witty book.I think that the most attractive thing about this book is how Chuck can find humour in the darkest situations. His satire criticizes society specifically the pointless addictions of people. Of course since the story is about a disfigured former model, the need for attention is what Chuk attacks the most. Through the whole journey it becomes clear how the maim character a.k.a. narrator, a.k.a. Daisy St. Patience, saw beauty as something not very fulfilling. It was clearly shown in the end that she felt ""fake"" when she was a model since everyone valued her appearance and not the character itself or the potential that she might have. When she revealed that she did that to her own face it felt like I could justify that character's action. Through the explanation of someone's feeling Chuck managed to normalize an action that is considered to be totally absurd.
It is also relatable with today's society since everyone is looking for attention more and more. Especially with the developement of social media. This book clearly shows how the attention is not the solution of not being happy and how everyone should do soul searching to find what is it that they really care about or what they love.
Also the style of writing was really strange but really interesting.
You can give me your thoughts about this book or the author, I would really like to read them.",0

197,"Question about 1984. Spoiler warning!Hey guys, first time poster here.

Anyway I just finished 1984 for the first time. Mandatory mention that it is in fact amazing.

But something is really bothering me about the plot, hope someone can ease those worries.

Why the hell does O'brien use SEVEN years doing a sting operation against Winston? Or simply why is Winston special at all? The society seems to have no qualms about vaporizing thought criminals after a single allegation, so why is Winston allowed to be an adulterer and enemy of the Party for so long?

Why bother with the pretense, the book and everything? Does everyone get this treatment? For sure this doesn't apply to Mr. Parson.

The only theory I have is that they want to build Winston up before brainwashing him. It still it seems very excessive and an unreasonable amount of resources must have been used on the operation.

I assume I must have missed something, anyone care to help me out?  

Cheers and thank you!",0

But after reading the book through twice I just haven’t been able to care enough about the characters or the stories enough to get into it. On top of that, the dialogue between characters and the brevity of each scene made the book almost unbearable to read in large portions at a time unless I wanted to feel lost. Seeing the hype for this book on top of seeing the hype for any blade runner movie (which is said to be based off of this book so I’ve heard?) that comes out is making me wary of ever seeing the movies.

It was such a thrilling read as soon as it started kicking into gear. 
The second half of the book was so gripping and even though I knew she’d be found out the end had me on the edge of my seat trying to find out if she’d get rumbled. I’ve not read any of John Carreyrou’s other books but he can really tell a good story.

I know I’ll read this again and I recommend it to anyone to read. It’s just so surreal that any of this was real. ",0
203,Where can I find in-depth articles on books without an academic subscriptionI  enjoy analysing books and finding out more about the authors' intentions and inspiration but aside from random googling. For example I'm reading Toni Morrison's Sula and would like to find out more about the context. What are goos sources for decent articles that don't require an academic subscription? Are there any blogs with in-depth reviews?,0

205,"Someone recommended ""The Summer That Melted Everything"" on here, I just finished it and thought it was incredible, definitely a summer must-read.This felt like a book that should be recommended to read in classes, it felt like one of those books that's so influential and does such a great job with it's storytelling that it felt like something that altered my perspectives on a lot of things.

The book is beautifully written, I found myself highlighting more sentences in this book than in any other book in years. I was surprised to see the author doesn't have any other books written yet as this one seemed so well-written. I haven't heard much about this book but I think it deserves more attention. I laughed, cried and audibly gasped while reading it.

I hope this convinces others to read it as it's such a great read, and thank you to whoever recommended it!",0
206,"Is there a book you reread on a schedule or when a certain life event happens?I’ve moved many times, and every time I move I read *Sleeping with the Enemy* by Nancy Price (the basis for the Julia Roberts movie). It’s about a woman who escapes an abusive marriage and starts over in a new town, so I always look to it for comfort after a move.

Then there’s *A Town Like Alice,* which I decided to read at least once a year (inspired by a fictional character who did that with her favorite book).

Which book is it for you?",0
207,"Book Club type booksI’m a first time poster on here so my apologies in advance if I’m going about things the wrong way. I was reading the post on books that people had given up before finishing and I had a few in mind. I realized that most of them were what I refer to as “Book Club” books. It used to be easy to spot them before the near downfall of physical bookstores but I’m sure that Amazon and other sites still promote them. I’m talking about the books that are usually farmed out to a big publisher’s subsidiary to make them seem less big business. They usually have a visually stimulating cover that’s different from a mass market book: lots of colors and hand drawn images. Often they will have a little symbol showing that they are part of Oprah’s book club, or won some obscure award, or lacking that sport a quote from a famous author extolling their virtues, or at worst say “the author of XY” even if you’ve never heard of XY before. 

They often have reviews saying that they are the “next great American novel” or more probably paid or quid pro quo-ed glowing reviews by more successful authors on the back or even on a display sign in a bookstore. If you’re a lover of books it’s often easy to get pulled in by such an obvious yet supposedly organic marketing campaign. These books are MORE than just a book you can pick up from the bestseller rack of pulp paperbacks. This is literature so you can feel like you are bettering yourself and feel smart when you bring them up to like minded people. 

The problem is a rather large number of them just suck. Now not all of them do. I have read some that I’d put in this category that were fine, some even pretty good. But many in my experience are just part of a simple yet effective marketing strategy as I said above.

One of the worst offenders that comes to my mind immediately is Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugeniedes. I think it actually WAS an Oprah book(I didn’t watch her show) about a young person in Detroit that was born a hermaphrodite. I guess it follows their struggle to find themselves with a bit of Detroit riots thrown in? I’m not really sure...it was long as hell and didn’t seem to have much of a point. Other examples off the top of my head are Life of Pi, at least two books by Jonathan Franzen, The Forgotten Garden by Kate Morton, the Kite Runner, and many, many more. I’m not saying that all of these books are bad, and I have to think that some people must like them. I’ve just been burned too many times by pretentious crap that IMO most people buy strictly so they can talk about them in a book club or to make themselves feel smart and well read. They also often focus on another culture or sexuality/lifestyles than what is perceived as the norm so that’s another feather in the cap for some I’m sure. 

So does my thesis have any merit? Do y’all like these books more often than I do? Are you ever taken in by marketing only to find you’ve bought a book that isn’t great? If you’re in a book club does it include a lot of “modern prestige literature” or books that everyone likes? Am I just a tremendous snob? Love to hear opinions on books that fall into my category and about particular books you loved or hated. I might be convinced to try one if the argument is good. 

WaaaayTLDR: I think that the publishing industry puts out a certain type of book and markets them as better than just a bestselling paperback even if they aren’t that good. Opinions wanted on these types of books and book clubs. Feel free to tell me I’m a snob or tell everyone how bad or great a prestige book really is. ",0

209,"The best kind of books change your life before you even know it's happening.I've read a number of self help books for very specific things. The Social Skills Guidebook, Models: Attracting Woman through Honesty, to name a few, were books that I sought out because I wanted a very specific kind of advice.

But then other books change your beliefs. And, with a sudden ease, you begin doing something new before you realize you've never done it before.

I remeber I read The Fountainhead by Ayn rand. I couldn't say why but right when I finished it I called my dad and told him what I really thought about my job, and how I wanted him to accept that.

I read No More Mr. Nice Guy. I didn't think I was ashamed of myself, but I suddenly resolved to be honest with my girlfriend about my real political views.

I've just finished the twelve rules for life. I've been kinder to myself, rewarding myself for the good things I do for myself. I stood on a 5 foot story ledge, just to feel the thrill of all that I can do, even in the face of fear and danger. And, best of all, I was finally honest with myself about my immense self hatred around being my true self with other people.

With so much to struggle for I'm grateful to have wise words bring so much into our lives.",0

211,"Pet Sematary - DiscussionI just finished reading Pet Sematary by Stephen King, and I have some STRONG FEELINGS GOOD GOD.

First of all, I'm struck with how much anxiety this book gave me while I read it. It was a really great anxiety though, and made me read on with this awesome anticipation I get when reading horror books. I felt the same way with Carrie, but this book was next level scary. There was a lot of detail between major events, but it all felt very in place, like the long, drawn out descriptions were perfect, not too long or boring. 

It was the perfect book for someone as death curious as me. There's a lot of taboo around death and dying, but this book satisfies some weird curiosity about it and really engrossed me in death without it being so obvious. There wasn't a violent description of the deaths, it was mostly implied, but my imagination went wild. 

I really loved this book. Have y'all read it, and what are your thoughts?? What some other books like this that y'all like?",0
212,"Question about ‘A Legacy of Spies’ (no spoilers please)Okay so I bought this book at the airport thinking “perfect! A book that isn’t part of a series that I can read without being caught up with 10 other books”... only to find out it was part of the George Smiley series.

So my question is, should I read the other Smiley books first? I’ve read that this one is both a prequel and a sequel to those books so I’m unsure of where to begin. I’m very wary of spoilers so researching makes it pretty hard so I thought I’d ask here.

Does this one spoil things from the other books? Will I even be able to understand what’s going on? Will I be able to enjoy this book on its own terms?

If not, what George Smiley books do I need to read first? All of them? Some of them?

Any and all advice is much appreciated, no spoilers please, 

Thanks!",0
213,"You guys are ruining my life with this Ender’s game business.Nothing but yikety yakety...Ender’s Game so amazing...blah blah...compelling read etc etc. 

Well, you all talked me into it and at 6:30 this morning I downloaded it while my coffee was brewing. Then at 7:00 I turned on the TV and set my kids in front of it because I was hooked. It’s 3:00pm and I’m 70% of the way through. Dishes are stacked to the brim. Kids are still in pjs. Dogs are bored and glaring at me. Toys are everywhere. My bedroom was turned into a fort/nest. I haven’t brushed my teeth. 

AND THERE ARE THREE MORE BOOKS!?!?

How will I get anything done? Will anyone ever do the dishes? Will Paw Patrol rot my kids’ brains? Will Ender save the world??? Stay tuned...


Edit: I just stopped to make coffee, do the dishes, and make sure the kids were alive. It made me realize I was doing that scene in Neverending Story where the little boy has a sandwich or something and looks at the storm and hunkers back down with the book. Back to reading!

Edit 2: It’s over, it’s done. What a day, what a story. Back to the old grind. 

Edit 3: for anyone still listening, the Speaker for the Dead book has been started, and is good. Reminds me a lot of the Children of Time book so far. But that one was a single reader and I think this one will be too. Ender’s Game will definitely be a multi-reader. Thanks to my husband who came home early from work because of the holiday weekend and has been parenting since 5 while I engage on this mad quest to do all the reading. 

Edit 4: The Speaker book has gotten pretty good. The piggy/fence situation reminds me of the movie “The Village”.  Thanks everyone for letting me know that there’s like 90,000 books in the series. I’ll definitely read them all! But probably not the same way as Ender’s Game. It’s so rare that a book just surprises you like that. I remember thinking the other day that I’ve read all the really good sci-fi books and I felt a little depressed about it. I’m really energized now to read more of the books that people post about on here.",0
214,"First time reading War &amp; Peace and I just can’t put it downI’m sure most of us have pulled a sickie at some point and curled up with a book, but doing that with War &amp; Peace is a dangerous game I’m trying to avoid or else I may lose my job! On the other hand, I’m glad it’s so long because I never want it to end. 

I’m just over 1/3 of the way through and this line struck a cord with me and I wanted to share:

 “‘People consider me a wicked man... and let them. I don’t care about anyone except those I love; but those I love so much that I’d give my life for them, and the rest I’d crush if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother, two or three friends... and to the rest I pay attention only insofar as they are useful or harmful.’” - Dolokhov, Volume 2, Part 1, Chapter 10. 

For anyone interested in reading I’d suggest reading another Russian classic first - one of my favourites is The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky. The reason I say this is because it can take a dozen chapters to get used to Russian naming conventions, and War &amp; Peace has over 500 characters so I imagine it would be quite easy to become overwhelmed and lose the thread if not used to Russian names (each Russian name has several variations with associated social nuances). 

I’m new to Russian classics but am completely enthralled. Suggestions on what to read next welcome!",0
215,"Changing mandatory literature at schoolsI am not a professor or anything , but I really think it is time to change mandatory literature at schools. I've read and hated all those books, boring as Hell and drama queens on every page of them. Taught me nothing. Everybody I know hated them. Even the kids who became professors later. They are still complaining about the same books.  
Just feel we should add something fresh, like Terry Pratchett, he was genius. I don't care about Anna Karenina and similar characters.  
We should be reading something useful. Discuss about something useful.  
Am I wrong?",0
216,"Why do most non-fiction books follow a similar pattern?I've seen this in a lot of books. The author introduces a concept(that is usually the title of the book) and the whole book revolves around that concept.
For example, the concepts of 'Skin in the Game' and 'Zero to one'. The whole book revolved around the one phrase.

Although I do not dislike it, it becomes very repetitive sometimes.

Why do you guys think that happens? ",0
217,"Rewarding myself with reading time instead of buying a new bookI’ve always rewarded myself for doing certain things (e.g., finishing a big project at work, cleaning the apartment) by buying myself a new book. It has taken me far too long to realize that buying a book sadly does not also buy the time to read it. I’ve started embracing minimalism over this summer and also want to start saving more money, so I’m hoping to cut down on book purchases—essentially, I need to stop using buying a new book as a reward. Instead, because I’m hoping to get through all of my TBR books I still own and haven’t yet decluttered so I can donate them after I finish reading them, I’m going to try to give myself the gift of guilt-free time to read as a reward instead of a new book purchase. 

Do you have any recommendations of things you do to make reading time feel more special and more like an “experience”? My ideas included making a favorite dessert to eat while I read or taking my book outside by the lake (but I can only do this for a few more weeks!). I welcome and would be grateful for other ideas!

218,"Rockets and Rainbows and Pynchon, oh my!Like every other redditor who has read Gravitys Rainbow, here I am to say; I just finished Gravitys Rainbow! Wow, what a ride. Ive read The Illuminatus! Trilogy at least five times and I recently finished Infinite Jest, so I think I was prepared in ways some are not to read it. Like IJ and Illuminatus, you have to be able to get through the first couple hundred pages to really immerse yourself in the world of the story, and you may have to be okay with having no idea what happened at the end. I know a lot of GR went flying right over my head...like the parabola of a rocket. Oh, you like the story arch of this character? Haha well now it's over and you have no idea what happened to them. And I hope you have an encyclopedic knowledge of history of WW2, and know German, or much of the story will have you hitting up Google constantly...if you care enough. Is what's happening in the story REALLY happening, is it a hallucination, or is it both? Keep your hands out of your pants if you want to finish the book, cuz it is chockerbock full of sex scenes that will have you shamefully aroused. I loved everything about this book and will definitely read it again sometime. It took me fifteen days to finish wish would usually be pushing my attention span, but I was right there the whole time, feeling lost and loving every word. This is not a book for everyone, and if I'm being honest with myself and anyone reading this, I am just a little bit proud to be part of the ones that finished it. I have V. that I will read soon, but if anyone has recommendations for anything like GR or IJ, I would like to hear them! Thanks guys and happy reading! ",0

222,"A scene interpretation from The Catcher in the RyeHi all,

This scene from chapter 9 in The Catcher in the Rye really stood out to me where Holden Caulfield is in a hotel room looking out the window and looking into other rooms.  In one room he sees a man dressing in women's clothing and in another room he sees a man and a woman spitting their drinks in each other's faces in a sexual way. 

Here is the scene in question, narrated by Holden:

""I saw one guy, a gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on, do something you wouldn't believe me if I told you.  First he put his suitcase on his bed.  Then he took out all these women's clothes, and put them on.  Real women's clothes, silk stockings, high-heeled shoes, brassiere, and one of those corsets with the straps hanging down and all.  Then he put on this very tight black evening dress.  I swear to God.  Then he started walking up and down the room, taking these very small steps, the way a woman does, and smoking a cigarette and looking at himself in the mirror.  He was all alone, too.""

He then goes on to describe the couple squirting their drinks in each other's faces.

My interpretation is that the cross-dresser and the fore-playing couple are Holden Caulfield.  This is for a few reasons.  The first being that Holden clearly lies uncontrollably.  He had to keep himself from talking on the train to the lady next to him in order to stop lying.  It seems his narration that he ""saw"" these strange acts could be a lie, especially as it is prefaced by him narrating ""you wouldn't believe me if I told you.""  It seems likely he lies in his narration, too.

Furthermore, the cross-dressing man was a ""gray-haired, very distinguished-looking guy with only his shorts on...""  This sounds like Holden, who we know has a lot of gray hair on one side of his head.  This man was also alone, as was Holden, and was smoking a cigarette, as Holden had been doing frequently leading up to this scene.

The women's clothing were also described in such detail, it's difficult to believe he actually recognized each article of clothing from a distance.  And the man was looking at himself in the mirror, which brings me to the next scene.

The couples spitting their drinks at each other was Holden doing it to his reflection in the mirror.  Here is the scene: ""Anyway, first he'd take a swallow and squirt it all over her, then she did it to him, they took turns, for God's sake.""

And after that scene, Holden felt aroused and called up a promiscuous girl who's number he had, presumably to try to have sex.  It seems possible these strange acts Holden performed aroused him.

One other thing is that before Holden went to the hotel, he got into a fight with his roommate Stradlater in part because Holden was mad/jealous about Stradlater's date with Jane where they likely had sex.  Holden asked Stradlater if they did, to which Stradlater got on Holden's bed and playfully punched in in the shoulder ""in just his damn shorts and all,"" just like the man in the window.  Holden has previously shown interest in Stradlater's body, so that's just interesting to note.

Any thoughts on this?  I did some googling but didn't find anyone with the same interpretation, which I think is really interesting and compelling.",0
223,"Fiction Readers - what's it like to read a story?I don't read - can you tell me what it's like?

I'm asking this as someone who's not a big reader due to ADHD, my brain just refuses to cooperate no matter how much I may want to read something, but even when I do read I tend to read non-fiction as it's easier to digest. I find fiction impossible as I can't read for long and I can't maintain focus on what I'm reading to get into a story, I also have [Aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia) so can't imagine what it is being described to me in a book.

Bookworms are into books in a way I don't think I could never understand - don't get me wrong, I love books as I was raised in a house full of books (my mother would spend hours reading, she could easily get through a  book a day) so I was raised to view them as something precious, but stories written within books are like some magical world I don't have access to. I don't understand how people can get so caught-up in the stories.

What's it like...

Do you visualize the world you're reading about?  
Do you really get a feel for the characters?

I hear people watching TV or film adaptations and say 'the book was better' but I have no idea how on earth words on a page could be comparable to a TV show or film, how a book can be so descriptive to be on comparison. I read each individual word, only half goes in, so I just can't see how bookworms see books.

FYI on what fiction I have managed to read: I've read most books by Michael Marshall Smith (the MMS books were easy for me), The Brothers Karamazov (yes that was very hard going!), Screwtape Letters I guess kind of count as fiction, and To Kill A Mocking Bird. I enjoyed them but I just don't think I enjoy them in the same way as bookworms enjoy reading.",0
224,"How do you keep track of what to read from multiple libraries?By this I mean, for example, I have a membership to my local library and a membership to the Free Library of Philadelphia.

If you use multiple libraries, how do you maintain a wishlist/want to read list without overlap?",0
225,"Sticker For Read Books On Shelves?Hey all! I have a large, and growing, collection of books (paper books not ebooks). I'm running into a bit of a predicament. I want to mark the books I've read with some sort of post it or sticker, but I don't want it to look tacky or ruin my book covers. I bought a large pack of those skinny post its that have a color at the end, but I don't like how it looks with them stuck on the spines because the colored part isn't sticky so it bends out. I also don't like the colored part sticking out the top of the book because I'd get really annoyed if they weren't even. I thought maybe just putting one on the inside cover, but then I would have to pull it off the shelf and look. This seems like a non-issue that I'm over thinking, but does anyone have suggestions for a quick and easy way to mark them? Thanks! ",0

228,"The First Chronicles of Amber is better than Lord of the Rings.The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny specifically. Change my mind.

229,"Check out this wild inscription in OJ Simpson's I Want to Tell You I found at the thrift store todayI idly picked up a copy of OJ Simpson's I Want to Tell You (1995) at the thrift store today. Inside the front, I discovered the following handwritten inscription taking up a full page (all spellings are correct):

&gt;Dear Ken — Here's to one of my best Fans — You always believed in me &amp; I know you will continue to help Find the ""Real"" killers — I'm sure they are golfer's that's why I spend so much time looking there — I appreciate all your help in the past. Keep it up. Remember all our good times in the old days — **I think I may marry again I want to take another Stab at it!** Best of everthing you old red neck —Your Friend The Juice

I don't know what to make of this. Has to be fake, right? But if fake, WHY?

The handwriting is a sort of haphazard mixture of small caps, lower case, and cursive, and it looks pretty similar to examples of OJ's handwriting I found online. Also there is no actual signature, only ""The Juice"" crammed in the extreme lower right corner. It's possible OJ (or whoever signed it) ran out of room for a full signature.

Very strange.

*  Kafka on the Shore
*  The wind-up bird chronicle 
*  Norwegian Wood

I think I liked all of them equally but enjoyed reading WUBC more. I found his writing style absolutely riveting. I can't believe I finished 1Q84 in just 10 days.

232,"First time reading The Hobbit, not what I was expecting and pleasantly surprisedA few years back after watching the excellent Lord of the Rings films I tried to get into the LOTR books to compare the films with the books, but I found the long descriptive writing hard to digest, especially compared to the action packed films, which caused me to drop the series midway through the first book and put me off trying to read anything Tolkien for awhile.

I'd only picked up The Hobbit after craving some fantasy and out of curiosity, and found that it couldn't be more different from LOTR. I found that where LOTR felt like I was slowly trekking along with the Fellowship, The Hobbit reads more action-packed, where at first Bilbo is meeting Gandalf and the dwarves, then Bilbo's trying to pickpocket trolls, then they're met with a big goblin army, then Bilbo's doing riddles and stealing a magic ring from Gollum in the dark, and the adventures continue.

I think I would've liked it a lot better if The Hobbit was adapted into a mini series instead of a movie trilogy, because the way it reads makes it feel like something you'd read a chapter a night to your kids. What are your thoughts on The Hobbit, and how it compares to Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works?",0
233,"[SPOILERS]Just listened to Murder on the Orient Express on audio book for the first time. Possibly the best mystery book I’ve ever readWow, what a ride. I was hooked from the first chapter. I’ll admit that I had my suspicions about certain characters being in on it. But it was only when a character made an offhand joke about everyone in the train being related to the child or her family in some way I realized what it was all heading

My jaw dropped and I knew right then that they were all co conspirators. This was right before the chapter where the detective offer is his solution to the mystery.

It was so satisfying thinking that I had caught on right before he revealed the truth in the book

Then I realized just how genius it all was. I went back and thought about all of the interactions Poirot (butchered the name) Had with every character and how each and everyone of those interactions was completely fake and calculated

And having Mrs. Hubbard Play the bumbling terrified old lady was genius. I can’t wait to dive into her other books",0

244,"Thoughts about Ishiguro's ""A Pale View of Hills"" tbat probably I'm the only one to have1. Etsuko and Seiji Ogata were totally into each other, and still are. They want each other so bad. Jiro probably knows or senses it at some level.

No, really, I could make that case.

A) Etsuko introduces Ogata to us by first dwelling on his physical attractiveness, comparing him most favourably to Jiro. Let this sink in for a moment. If a guy were to start telling us about how sexy his mother-in-law was compared to his pudgy dowdy wife, well, God bless you please, Mrs Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you can know!

B) Their banter is of such a flirtatious nature that surely others have had the same notion I hold. Naughty words about withholding favours or doling out punishment while actually going the extra mile for him. Ribbing him about his ugly name. Him reciprocating by making fun of his own ugliness. If they were to ever get down to hot and heavy things it'd be kinky as all get out. Real potential for light BDSM dynamics here.

C) The azaleas. With the way that scene is constructed in the novel, the subtext of attachment, mutual desire and attraction, and repressed emotion is so strong that I think the azaleas got fertilised by their pheromones. There is the sense of finality in the way Ogata describes ""the day it was all finally decided. That you and Jiro were to be married"". That final decision caused Etsuko to make the wild presumptuous demand for a house with ""azaleas in the gateway"" if she was to live there, a demand Ogata complied with without delay. Subtext: ""if what we feel cannot be openly acknowledged, I must have at least a tacit symbolic acknowledgement. Give it to me, or I won't agree to this alternative socially-acceptable arrangement."" And Ogata is so obviously hurt by her momentary failure to grasp his reference to the azaleas, when he is standing by the window making it hard for Etsuko to see his expression. She doesn't need to, though. The mere use of this narrative contrivance tells us she knows full well the unspoken conversation they are having.

And more: she disavows the decision made by Jiro to move out into their own apartment. She knows that decision caused hurt. For her own part she wanted to stay, at least under the same roof as Ogata. Ogata's simple response of ""No"" is him giving her absolution for the moving out. This is some forbidden Sweet May Chill December love story right here.

D) ""Yes,very guilty. I wonder what Father gets up to when there's no one to keep an eye on him."" Oh wouldn't you like to know, Etsuko, wouldn't you like to know. 

2. The missing black silk tie. Ogata probably took it and was contemplating hanging himself, when he didn't come out of the bedroom that morning. Etsuko was disproportionately relieved when she called out and he answered, aftee Jiro had gone. The unspoken un-narrated thought must have occurred to her.

3. The use of international chess rather than Go is not, after all, on account of Ishiguro not being familiar with Go's mechanics, but because he really did want the somewhat quaint metaphors made possible by the mechanics of international chess. Instead of ""rook"", Ogata says ""castle"" - players don't usually use that term to describe the playing piece (albeit ""castling"" is a move), but here the effect is that the idea of a castle's fortifications is an apt metaphor for Jiro's attempt to stonewall his father regarding Shigeo Matsuda. Likewise, Ogata refers to the knight as a ""horse"", which frankly seems a bit odd. Here, however, it serves as a kind of metonym for travel, departure... Ogata is saying, in effect, that Jiro's decision to move out was ill-considered. Lots of things are happening in that scene of course, but the particular terms Ogata was using caused me tl change my mind about why the author chose to deploy chess rather than Go.

245,"Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 &amp; 1984 Am I understanding these correctly?So I just finished BNW &amp; fished the other two a while back but I don't think I fully grasp what they are about.

BNW: They basically turned humanity into a machine right? People were desperately wanting calm and stability after the nine years war and basically took away free will and made them all robots.

Fahrenheit 451: Everyone wanted instant gratification and books didn't give them that so they were banned &amp; destroyed, basically there wasn't malicious intent just the masses didn't like stories that took to long and didn't bring about joy and satisfaction.

1984: Holy shit, essentially You Can't Win. He went full on horror with the story and in the end you can never win, The Party &amp; Big Brother are immortal and no matter what you try to do they will always be ahead of you.

1984 was the only one that gave me chills while reading, there really was no end game for the party or O'Brien but it seemed like O'Brien was actually Big Brother the whole time.

I was shocked when I saw BNW was done in 1932, so to see what it was like without the Nazi influence of being the most horrible thing to happen to humanity was a surprise.",0
246,"I just read the invention of Hugo cabret and I loved it!I'm a fifteen year old boy who's going to a new school next week, and I've been feeling kind of down. I was looking at my shelf and saw the invention of Hugo cabret, that my grandmother gave me a few years ago. I decided out of nowhere to read it. I read it this afternoon and found it to be a very beautiful story. 

But the part that I've been thinking about is when Hugo says to Isabella ""I like to imagine that the world is one big machine. You know, machines never have any extra parts. They have the exact number and type of parts they need. So I figure if the entire world is a big machine, I have to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason, too.""

It made me feel as if everything I've been worried about lately going to be okay. I was surprised to see that a book that's been sitting on my shelf for three years that I randomly read helped me so much. I know it may sound weird but I wanted to share this with you guys. Thanks!",0
247,"I'm Mary Robinette Kowal, author of The Lady Astronaut duology, professional puppeteer and audiobook narrator. AMAHi there! I'm Mary Robinette Kowal and I have three unrelated careers. I'm an author, a professional puppeteer, and an audiobook narrator.

My short fiction is sort of all over the speculative fiction map. My novels are science-fiction or fantasy. (So far.) The first series, The Glamourist Histories, is sort of like Jane Austen with magic. Then I did Ghost Talkers, which is set in WWI with ghosts and mediums and spycraft and stuff like that. But you're probably interested in the Calculating Stars, which is book one of the Lady Astronaut duology. Oh! And if you want to read free stories, [I have some on my site](http://maryrobinettekowal.com/fiction-collectio/online-fiction/). I’m also a member of the Hugo-award winning podcast [Writing Excuses](https://writingexcuses.com/).

So there's also the puppetry. In high school, I was doing puppetry as a hobby, but I went after an art degree, minoring in theater and speech. While performing as Audrey II in a performance of Little Shop of Horrors, a professional puppeteer came to the show and I was like... ""Wait. People actually pay you? To do this?"" And pretty much changed career paths on the dime. I went on to intern at the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, GA. With over twenty years of experience, I have performed for LazyTown (CBS), the Center for Puppetry Arts, Jim Henson Pictures and Sesame Street. You got questions about puppets? I got answers.

For the audiobook stuff, I'm a member of SAG/AFTRA. As the voice behind several audio books and short stories, I've recorded fiction for authors such as Neal Stephenson, Cory Doctorow and Seanan McGuire. And my own books, too. It's sorta like puppetry, without the pain.

I live in Chicago with my husband Robert and, at current count, nineteen manual typewriters.

And now random stuff -- I lived in Iceland for year and a half, working on the show Lazytown. Two cats. I'm obligated to mention the cats, right? I include a Doctor Who cameo in every novel. 

When I say that you can ask me anything, I really mean it. I’ll talk about everything from hand-sewing period costumes, to shoving my hand up things, to writing, to depression.

248,"On The Move: A Life by Oliver SacksAn incredibly gifted nurologist and an even more amazing person, Oliver Sacks sadly passed away in 2015 but left an amazing collection of literary works.  This memoir is a journey through his life, and it is quite gripping!  You'll fall in love with Sacks writing, it often times fells as if your there sharing a stiff drink and listening to him tell stories.  

Parts that come to mind are his time as a power weight liftier on the beaches of California.  His love of motorcycles.  Riding through Europe (I may be wrong on the local) on the open air section of a train, polishing off a bottle of liquor, and a James Joyce book, just for fun!  His intelligence jumps out of the pages as does his thoughtfulness. 

His blending of religion and medicine and his humanizing approach to his patients was incredibly touching and will always stand out when thinking about the book!  What parts of On The Move did you find the most touching or memorable?  His shy personality and beautiful letters with family members always stand out in thinking of the book!  This was my first introduction to Oliver Sacks, there is now a shelf dedicated to him on my bookshelf.  Did you have the same experience?

249,"The Captain Underpants Series is Some of the Best Children's Books Ever.When I was a kid these books were the best. Everyone, boys and girls loves them. Even the kids who didn't like to read read them. 

Not only were the books silly and ridiculous, they were also very cleaver. I had recently reread ""Captain Underpants and the Wrath of the Wicked Wedgie Woman"" and I loved it more that I did when I was a kid. Who knew that a book about a school teacher with radioactive hair fighting a middle-aged school principle in tighty-whiteies and drapes would make a smart and engaging story? 


But the main reason I love it because of how much the book encourages creativity like writing and drawing. 
The main characters, George and Harold, make comic books together (George would write, and Harold would draw) I don't know why but that really stuck with me. It made made me want to make comics at the time and later on inspired me to want to make comics seriously. 
Who knows how many other kids Dav Pilkey inspired! Too bad that some schools actually banned these books :(


I really do hope that the author continues making books like Captain Underpants because they really did help the kids of my generation love reading and creativity.

It was recommended to me by my friend as we exchanged books before parting ways for college and it’s a book I might not have picked up otherwise.

The chapter begins by telling you how his mother died at the hands of Owen Meany’s foul ball, then spends time away for the awhile to develop the characters. Once the characters were developed substantially, it describes the incident of the foul ball in detail and it’s so much more powerful. You feel the emotion that the narrator seems distant from.

261,"The Master and Margarita by Mikhail BulgakovThe translation I read was from Burgin and O'Conner.  The Master and Margarita is a very powerful and sometimes pointed read that definitely illicited a wide swath of emotions. 

Living under the harsh rule of the Soviet Union in the early 1900's Bulgakov wrote this beautiful satirical piece only to have it stiffled by the ruling party of the time.  I think his anger towards censorship and forced conformity comes across in his writing.  Especially with the hardships the master goes through in trying to publish his book about Pontius Pilate within the story, and the emotional toll that it takes on him.  

There are several stories that comengle and touch on one another but the main plot line is about the devil arriving in Moscow and what happens afterwards.  The terms of good and evil are examined and played with. This book can be comedic, and tragic all at once.  Bulgakov does a wonderful job mixing in humor with darker subject matter which will make you laugh and cry.

Bulgakov's writing will keep you immensly captured by his story.  I love all the people you meet along the way and the events that you sit in on!  I absolutely loved his characters, especially Woland! 

Did The Master and Margarita make you think of your own sense of good and evil?  Do you think Bulgakov was drawing parrelles between the master in his book and himself living in the censored Soviet Union?  Did the ending sit well with you and do you think he was making commentary on living under such harsh conditions?  This is such an amazing book, if you haven't  read it I highly recommend it.  If you've only read it once I would suggest giving it another read!  Definitely one of my favorite books in general, especially from a  Russian author! 

One of my favorite quotes from the book:

""The tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes never! You're asked an unexpected question, you don't even flinch, it takes just a second to get yourself under control, you know just what you have to say to hide the truth, and you speak very convincingly, and nothing in your face twitches to give you away. But the truth, alas, has been disturbed by the question, and it rises up from the depths of your soul to flicker in your eyes and all is lost.""",0
262,"I’m almost done with The Warded Man, and would love to have a discussion on Leesha and the treatment of women in fantasy.Hey all. I’m currently almost done with The Warded Man, and I just finished reading about Leesha’s rape. This was kind of the final straw for me for this book and I wanted to hear some other people’s thoughts because I know this is a pretty popular series. 

I’ve had issues with the way Brett wrote Leesha from the beginning. He seemed to present her as this girl that was constantly crying and weak, and spent a weird amount of time and detail describing her and Gared’s hook up when she was literally only 12, which was really gross to me. I do appreciate her growth as an extremely competent Herb Gatherer and she did grow up quite a bit, but I find it really frustrating that she kept up her habit of crying at the first sign of inconvenience or danger rather than maybe expanding on her skills as an Herb Gatherer and drawing strength them. I kind of feel like that this is just some kind of personal fantasy that he’s projected on Leesha of this beautiful girl that’s incapable of taking care of herself and has to rely on other people constantly, and I’m hoping that I haven’t made it far enough in the series to see her fully develop as a character. The way he’s written her up to this point just really turned me off to this series to the point where I’m questioning if I want to finish it. 

In general, I have an issue with how much rape is used as a plot device in fantasy books. Before anyone lays into me for this, I understand that the time period and setting for most fantasy books is in a time where rape was very common, but I just don’t understand why it’s so vital to so many plots. Leesha’s just seemed so crude and unnecessary, and Brett only seemed to use it to drive the point home that she’s fragile and needs someone to take care of her. 

I’d love to know if this is how it continues for the rest of the series because I really do enjoy the story, but I just can’t handle how Brett is writing this character that has so much more potential than a simpering wallflower. 

Without going into detail and also as something I’d like to not focus on, I’m a victim of sexual assault and I try to make sure that that isn’t something that influences my life and other experiences I have. Because of that, I’d also like to know if anyone else gets the sense that women in fantasy go through some shit, or if this is just something I’m more sensitive to and is something I can work on.",0

264,"""The Little Stranger"" by Sarah Waters - Identity of the PoltergeistI assume there's probably some of you reading this book, since the movie adaptation comes out tomorrow. That's how I first heard of it. I read it over the past week and it's an excellent gothic novel, I definitely want to read more of Waters' novels after this one.

I had an interesting theory about the ""ghost"" in the story after finishing it and wanted to get some discussion about it.

Towards the end, Caroline suggests that the ghost may actually be a poltergeist caused by Rod's mental stress. In parapsychology a ""poltergeist"" is generally thought to be psychic energy created by a living person, not the spirit of someone dead.

I think the poltergeist is actually Dr. Faraday.

Faraday has always been fascinated by Hundreds Hall - in the beginning, he tells us about when he broke off a piece of the molding as a child, since he wanted a part of the house for himself, even if it meant damaging part of it. His marriage to Caroline at the end seems to have the same selfish goal - what he really wants is to inherit the house, and he disregards her happiness and mental state to get it.

I think Faraday is unaware he's causing anything to happen (typical of poltergeist cases), and genuinely is a skeptic when it comes to the paranormal. But the events caused by the haunting are serving his subconscious desire to remove the Ayres family and take the house for himself.

He's born from a lower class and, as a doctor, he's a self-made man who strives to be like the wealthy upper class but doesn't have the ""old money"" background like the Ayres. The house probably represents that to him, and he makes reasons to stay with the family (as their doctor) so he can be there as often as possible, and eventually gets the idea to marry Caroline (but I think all she really represents to him is the house).

I think a subconscious part of Faraday hates the Ayres family for not taking proper care of the place. Rod and Mrs Ayres already have unstable mental conditions, but I think they actually did witness supernatural activity. Their condition just made them more susceptible to it, and then Faraday can diagnose them as unstable and seems almost eager to get them out of the house.

I didn't really think of Faraday as the ""antagonist"" of the novel until he started pressuring Caroline to marry him, but really all throughout the novel he's working to get Rod and Mrs Ayres to get committed to institutions, he kills Gyp ""because it's the right thing to do"", and generally manipulates Caroline so that they can marry and (more importantly) he becomes the owner of the house.

And in the end, when Hundreds Hall is abandoned (partially because of the ghost stories), he still has the key and still goes back to ""maintain"" the empty house. He's also unaffected by the ghost, despite how much time he spent in the house. The final paragraph suggests he was the thing haunting the family all along:

&gt; If Hundreds Hall is haunted, however, its ghost doesn't show itself to me. For I'll turn, and am disappointed - realising that what I am looking at is only a cracked window-pane, and that the face gazing distortedly from it, baffled and longing, is my own.",0

266,"What is the best subscription service for audiobooks?I read a lot as a child, but fell off when I went to college because of massive amounts of course work. Now I am an adult that commutes about 2 hours a day and I have become obsessssed with audiobooks, burning through 3-4 a month easily.  

Audible is great and has a great selection, but I find it difficult to justify the cost, but I love the set up and the fact that they keep track of how many hours of books you have listened to.

269,"The Road by Cormac McCarthy and my reading levelHi everyone :)

I just finished The Road by  Cormac McCarthy  a few days ago, and against all the critics and the Pullitzer Price that it received, I didn't like the book so much. 

I know the book is very special, by the facts that they are no chapters, the characters are totally disincarnated (no name, very few physical description), no informations on where does the story take place, on the past of the world or on his future, etc. 

I know that it was intended by the author to make it the more universal story possible I think, but it keeps me emotionally  out of it, I didn't get attached to the characters or to the world. I don't discredit the author at all, Cormac McCarthy have a huge writing talent, of description and atmosphere, it's really impressive. But at the end, I feel like there not much a story in there, that's it's way too much philosophic and allegoric for me, except for two or three moments. 

There are a lot of people who enjoy the book, there are some who had the same experience as me. What do you think of The Road ? 

And also my other question is, The Road is the first Pullitzer Winner book that I read, are they all like that ? I've not a very high reading level, I would say I'm an average reader, should I avoid Pullitzer Winners ? Or was this a misluck experience ?

270,"Rust &amp; Stardust - no spoilers, just a review/overviewWhen I read the blurb about Rust &amp; Stardust being an influential true crime story that urged Nabakov to complete Lolita, I figured I'd like it. I gave it a sample reading and was so hooked I actually purchased the digital version (usually I wait til the library loans it to me). This book just came out and it's a really good read. The books that come to mind to compare it to kind of give away the plot points, but it's basically a fictionalized account of a kidnapping - an 11 year old girl, Sally Horner, kidnapped by a convict, Frank. He keeps her for a long time and you really get in Sally's head and see what a little girl might think in that situation. More innocent than Room (Emma Donoughue [sp?]), more realistic than Where I Left Her (the other T. Greenwood book I devoured after this one) and  if you like reimagined true crime (is that a genre?) I think you'd like it. Has anyone else read it? The author spoke in Portland last night at Powell's with the author of Sold on a Monday, about a photograph of a mother selling 4 children. Both stories took place in 1948 and are dramatized fiction centered around a real story. ",0

277,"I just finished Jane Austen’s *Emma*, and it completely changed my perspective on classics.I’m not a big ‘classics’ reader. At all. 

Though I do love to read, I never could force myself to sit down with *To Kill a Mockingbird* or *Jane Eyre* outside of a school setting. For whatever reason, renowned literary classics all seem to have a really long, really boring introduction at the beginning in which nearly nothing happens except the characters are introduced in the most ‘tell-not-show’ way possible. And even though the books are - obviously - old, and will therefore have an older writing style, I just couldn’t find the strength to plough through it. Heck, I even struggled reading *Anne of Green Gables*.

I figured, for a long time, that I just wasn’t a classics person. I would never be in the upper-class of the literature world, but instead be forever confined to the looked-down-upon YA books that I somehow never grew out of. That aspect didn’t really bother me; why waste time reading something *slow* and *boring* when I could be reading about a teenage half-dragon princess leading a rebellion against her own kingdom (or something?) without the convoluted writing style or depth that many classics seem to have (that inevitably flew over my head)?

Well, I’m here to tell you that I was wrong.

My friend recommended *Emma* to me on the one condition that I would read it. All of it.

I recognized the author, but apart from that, that’s all I recognized. To give you an idea of how detached I was from the literate elite, I thought Pride and Prejudice was about *war*. 

You can imagine my confusion when *Emma* was...also not about war.

I’m not going to lie, the first chapter was *rough*. As soon as I read the first sentence - “Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, blah blah blah...” I thought, *oh boy. Here we go.*

But...I actually really liked it. 

Even though the writing style was old, it didn’t *feel* old. In fact, it read like a modern romantic comedy. Emma’s antics were actually pretty funny, and one scene especially - in which Emma literally pries her shoelace off and chucks it into the bushes as an excuse to give two characters more alone time - made me laugh out loud. I usually hate romance novels, but I would actually go as far to say that Jane Austen’s books are probably the only kind of romance that I’m able to stomach.

At one point, I remember thinking, “*This* is what people are so excited about?” I couldn’t believe it. It wasn’t what I expected at all: it wasn’t full of messages I didn’t understand or weighed down by language or any of those things. It was just fun. 

That being said, I absolutely understand why it’s highly regarded - Austen has a way of creating characters and situations that are completely timeless and authentic, as well as providing a glimpse into the social climate of the 1800s. 

I definitely encourage anyone who’s never had a taste for classics to give this book a try. There are a couple things I would recommend, however, rather than jumping in blindly:

**Get a copy that’s annotated,** or at the very least has footnotes of some kind. Mine was an Oxford copy that I got from the library, and the definitions and historical context notes at the back were so, so helpful when reading. Otherwise, I never would have known that shaking hands were only reserved for close friends, or that calling someone by their first name was considered highly disrespectful if you didn’t know them personally. It really helps you understand what you’re reading. However, *don’t* read the introduction until after you’ve read the book. It contains a whole bunch of spoilers.

**Keep track of the characters.** A ton will be introduced at the beginning, and many of them will be important later. I started writing notes on them but later stopped when I became used to remembering who’s-who. Also: DO NOT look up any character maps or notes online, because you WILL run into spoilers. :( That’s why it’s good to use an annotated edition, so the notes are right there and you don’t have to search around in the angry abyss of the Internet for them. 

And finally, **you will get used to the prose after a while.** The old style annoyed me at first, but now I can’t imagine the story being told any other way. 

Anyway, that’s all! Because I liked *Emma* so much, I’m probably going to read *Mansfield Park* next (although I’m scared that it won’t measure up!!) ",0
278,"Anyone else got a problem with violent content?Hi Everyone,

The first time I noticed this problem was through my reading of Stephen Kings ""IT"". 300-400 Pages through the book I was really invested in it and thought the story awesome. But then a scene happened, in which a woman was abused by her violent boyfriend, that brought me to a stop. I just couldn't read further. My stomach hurt every time I thought about those scenes and all the previous emotions of joy were now just in disgust. The same feeling happened in some other books that were recommended to me.
 
There is no problem when I watch violent movies or play bloody videogames. When something graphical is happening in this media I normally think to myself ""oh fuck that was intense"" but when I read those passages in books it's more like ""meh there is no joy in this, it just hurts"" 

My fear is to misjudge books by this flaw of mine. For example I almost stopped reading the game of Thrones series because of the Sansa pov's.

Anyone of you feels the same? Do you have some tips to avoid this thoughts?

287,"Just finished Haruki Murakami's THE ELEPHANT VANISHESThe stories in this book are nearly all about neurotic characters who discover something of mystery in the world before realizing that it isn't worth their while to find a solution, instead opting to enjoy the conundrum. They tend to be sociable people who still find themselves feeling more alone when they spend time with others, understanding the discrete distinctions between them and those around them. Astute observations about the nature of humanity and the individual's relationship to the commune abound, and Haruki Murakami's careful writing implies a growing lethargy associated with learning more about these ideas, an effective application of the Socratic paradox. It is easy to feel an immense, droning sadness when reading this short story collection while also feeling comfort in the idea that loneliness is part of existence. The MVP award goes to ""Barn Burning,"" a paragon of the ideas I mentioned and a beautiful narrative nearly as sprawling as anything else in the book.

I also loved Jaeden Lieberher in St. Vincent, and I think he'd be a really great Simon; they're both very soft-spoken.

289,"East of Eden - questions and observationsFirst of all, sorry for yet another post about ""East of Eden"" if you're tired of seeing them. I know that quite a few posts already exist, but I didn't feel like I could just put my comments onto an old thread and I'm also wondering if someone might be able to help me out with studying the book. I read it in a paperback version from the library, but I'm going to immediately buy the digital version so I can highlight and write notes the second time around. Does anyone have any suggestions for reading guides or discussion groups for this book? 

I've read a few of Steinbeck's other works (Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, The Grapes of Wrath, The Pearl) and while I appreciated them, none of them had nearly the beauty or impact that ""East of Eden"" did. I started reading it because of all the recommendations here on this sub and I just finished it less than 20 minutes ago. I spent at least 7 hrs. reading in the past 2 days, I just couldn't stop. 

I've read a lot of novels I'd been told I should love and haven't. I've read countless classics that were just a chore. This was an experience that I wasn't really prepared for, even after all the glowing reviews. I didn't skip a single word. I never found myself scanning or skipping paragraphs. I was simultaneously rabidly jealous of Steinbeck's mastery of words and imagery as well as deeply sad that he's gone. I can't count the number of times I read a sentence or paragraph two or three times in a row, just to savor it. I know there's more of his work that I haven't read, but I want MORE than that even. Hope that makes sense. 

For me, the commentary on cycles, on life and death, were more impactful than the good vs. evil themes. As a middle aged woman, reading about people confronting their mortality head on was refreshing and reassuring. I couldn't even BEGIN to list my favorite lines, but this paragraph hit me like a ton of bricks, "" “I’m a nosy old man, Adam. And the sad thing to me is that I’m losing my  nosiness. That’s maybe how I know it’s time to visit my children. I’m  having to pretend to be nosy a good deal of the time.”""

I can already feel the beginnings of that in myself, even at 41. I'm not on the cutting edge of technology anymore. I don't know who all the new, popular musicians and actors are. I don't want to spend hours just sitting around, talking about other people. I don't understand ASMR or why kids think it's satisfying to watch soap being cut! I've lost a lot of my nosiness already. That paragraph felt similar to the descriptions I've read in other books about very old vampires just losing interest in everything before walking into the sun. 

On a different note, Lee is by far my favorite character. I laughed out loud quite a few times at his dialogue. His tragic back story absolutely took my breath away.

291,"Trilby by George du MaurierTrilby by George du Maurier is an 1895 Victorian novel that takes place in 1750 Bohemian France. The book is said to be the inspiration for Phantome de l'Opera. But is more so a study in Bohemia.


The book is wordy, onerously so. The author takes a page and a half for what could be conveyed in one sentence. The text almost seems pretentiously written. It makes frequent allusions to authors, artists of the time. It made me feel clever and intelligent for recognizing names and stupid all at once for not being able to appreciate the metaphors.


The lengthy paragraphs are made worse with the heavily salted French interspersed at about once per page. I'm familiar with some French, but was using Google Translate for about half the phrases. 


Throughout, the author is reminiscent of France, putting himself on the periphery of the characters. He expounds on rues, boulevards, venues, and restaurants. This first hand account requires the reader to have a knowledge of Paris either before or during reading.


The characters are thoroughly examined. Their portrait studies can go for pages. So then, their actions can become predictable. Nothing really seems to happen for the first half of the book. We are thoroughly introduced to Billie, the Laird and Taffy. I admit, I got the Laird and Taffy confused in my mind. The author reminds each time about the characters traits so that you can remember who it is that's doing the action. The other main characters, Trilby and Svengali make a believable interaction. Their periphery friends are inconsequential.


There seems to be a lack of action on everyone's part. I can't remember the word, but Billie's mother acts as pro and antagonist. That's when things get rolling, in the second half of the book - and ever so slowly still!


This book got great reception when released. I'd say because it was in the papers as a French tourist advertisement.


I'll give du Maurier this: the lengthy descriptions are artfully written. When taking in a saturated paragraph at a time, it would be easy to linger in the subtleties and allusions of each one. I have half a thought to re-read it, but to stop each time I come across a reference I don't fully understand.",0

298,"Why is Bret Easton Ellis’s novel titled after Elvis Costello’s “Less Than Zero?” (&amp; Imperial Bedrooms?)Just finished Less Than Zero. A great read overall! But I’m curious why Ellis chose to title it after this Elvis Costello song. Obviously the title refers to Costello’s 1977 song from the album My Aim is True. And Imperial Bedrooms in turn refers to Costello’s 1982 album Imperial Bedroom. 

Costello’s “Less Than Zero” lyrically refers to the British neofascist and racist Oswald Mosley going on TV attempting to deny his hateful actions. This rightfully pissed Costello off, and I understand reading the song on that level. 

But I’m unsure how lyrically Costello’s song relates to Ellis’s novel, if at all. Maybe Ellis simply listened to a lot of Costello (Clay has a Costello poster, Blair and Clay used to listen to Costello’s records). Does Costello’s music evoke an aesthetic fitting of the novel and its themes? 

When I think of 80s music, I don’t really think of Costello. Ellis’s later reference in Less Than Zero to Randy Newman’s ironic “I Love LA” makes more sense to me.

I don’t know that much about Elvis Costello or his music, or the 80s music scene, so I’m curious about why Ellis was inspired to name both novels after Costello’s music. Maybe someone on here can explain why?

300,"Guns of the South - Is there any time travel novel aching for a film adaptation as hard as this one?In case you haven't read it, Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove is a fantastic novel in the ""alternate history"" genre. It is about a group of time travelers from the distant future who return to Civil War America in order to equip the Confederate army with modern weaponry like AK-47s. There are themes very relevant to today's society. 

Some spoilers follow....

The results are as expected, and the South wins the Civil war easily. But that's just the start of a tale that is so twisty turny that Robert E. Lee ends up becoming a sympathetic protagonist before the end, once he realizes what's actually happening. 

I would cast Robert Downy as Robert E. Lee https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTQ1MjUxNTQxOTMzMTA2NjU3/robert-e-lee---mini-biography.jpg

301,"Finished A River in Darkness by Masaji Ishikawa and Wow, What a ReadI read this book in a day (fairly short at 172 pages) and while the writing is simple, I absolutely loved this book. Not much is known about North Korea other than that it's a nuclear threat or when it's being made fun of, but reading this book made me realize the seriousness of  what North Korea really is and what it's doing to people even in this very moment. Genocide is being committed to its people and yet, most of the world is so unaware of what's really going on. And the sad part? Those who do know (at the top level) aren't doing much. Anyways, to focus more on the book itself, the author really takes the reader into his world (a more personal narrative) of what survival is really like. It's the simple details of the book that really make the reader cringe (like when the author describes how constipated they would be from eating poisonous plants they they would finger their anuses to defecate) or feel sadness (how the author would run from door to door asking mothers to breastfeed his baby since they had no food) or feel anger (how the authorities would punish the sick or elderly by rationing them less food). The author showcases his suffering through his writing and it has the desired effect on the reader. However, still not much is known about the author himself. It's a sad book, heartbreaking, but definitely worth the read if you are interested in the topic. If anyone has any more information on this book or the author, please share. ",0

303,"A Tale of Two Cities and Les Miserable, what is the female's character significanceLes Miserable and A Tale of Two Cities both have beautiful women coming of age to soften the hearts of father like figures.I watch the movie Les Miserable (1998) and am reading A Tale of Two Cities. In Les Miserable the daughter is an adopted daughter. After her prostituting mother dies the protagonist takes the daughter and raises her as his own. As I read A Tale of Two Cities, the girl is bringing her father back to life after his years of entrapment in forced labor. Both take place in France during the revolution. I feel like this is the way the characters are written, because of the time the authors are writing. This is how men thought of young women in mid to late 1800's. Both were publish within 5 years of each other, and there may be no significance to the female character's youth and beauty. I'm really interested in hearing your thoughts. What is the significance or why is this character type being repeated in both novels?

I recently, over the course of four months read the Stormlight Archive series, nearly 3500 pages, fantastic, loved it and cant wait for the 4th book.

After reading that, I wanted something easier to read, short and no series unless it was a short series 

I decided to start Six of Crows, had read some good things about it, has a great good reads score and its only 2 books and they're short.  Well I got through the first two chapters and I couldn't continue on.

I dont mind YA, the characters were fine from what I had read, the world and magic work intrigued me enough, but her writing style just felt off, it just felt so undeveloped.  So I decided to put it down and I will try again down the road, but after having read almost 3500 pages in Sanderson's fantastic style, I think any other fantasy series was probably going to feel lacking and my brain needed a break from fantasy and his style.

I read for enjoyment, fiction/non-fiction doesn't matter, after I come from work and before sleep and I want a book which is subtle and written with grace. And I think this is main fault of this book. 

I found some sections of the book where Dawkins made some comments, which belittled religious people and are immature, self-centered and not acceptable for professional writing.

Now after completing the book I researched about it and to my surprise, I came to know that this book was written for 'on the fence' theists and I was dumbfounded, I mean with that writing style I think you shouldn't approach a theist. So, no I wouldn't have recommended it to a theist.

315,"Don Quixote is like the medieval version of I Love Lucy.Don Quixote is one of the greatest novels of all time, and i want to read it big time indeed!

It is just like the equivelent of a fan who reads too many books (thrillers, fantasy, science fiction, comic, or even Shakespearian works), and becomes anyone he wants to do, just like Don Quixote. These examples of who would they become would include:

\- Becoming a detective or a professor but in reality, it is impossible to proof it to the police, nor they would allow you to teach history, or even investigate a crime scene.

\- Becoming a wizard or a sorcerer, but in reality, there is no magic in the real world and he would not be like Harry Potter, or Lord Voldemort.

\- Becoming a jedi warrior or a space captain, but, again in reality, the fans of Star Wars and Star Trek would call him crazy if he is imagining a spaceship in the sky.

\- Becoming a comical woman like in most 50s shows, but in reality (why do i keep saying it over and over again?), There is no way to become one unless you are hired by the three or four networks like NBC, CBS, ABC, or The CW, in order to be part of a show (alas a sitcom).

\- Or even becoming each or one of the characters from William Shakespeare, those include Romeo and Juilet and Hamlet (which they are the most famous works from him).

Those are the examples of a big fan that would become those that i have pointed out to you.

Speaking of the 4th example, i will say this, Don Quixote is the medieval version of the sitcom I Love Lucy, the reason?

Well, because DQ is episodic, some people read every chapter of this book as a episode (either as a sitcom or a satrical series), and they would take a break for now and come back for after, later, or even tomorrow, so that they can treat it as a series.

Also, just like DQ, I Love Lucy has humor as well (which those notable examples include Lucy testing Vitametavegamin in the first season's well known episode, Lucy and Ethel in the candy factory fiasco in Season 2's Job Switching, and so on and etc.).

I can also compare between Lucy and Ricky Riccardo and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, but with differences. Ricky does the drums while Sancho rides the ass (which is technically a donkey) and worked for the goverment in the second part, and Lucy works as his housewife, wanting to become a star, while Don Quixote becomes a madman, trying and wanting to right the wrongs of the world.

That is why DQ is the medieval equivelent of I Love Lucy, and i wonder if you can compare Miguel De Cervantes's novel with anything that you remembered or watched in recent years.

Before that there was this great build-up filled with classic horror scenes set on an intriguing premise: an ancient force that lives underneath a city that changes its form to terrorize and eat children. 

But the resolution? The book ends with strange, almost low-effort notions on cosmology and magic that seem incoherent with the themes previously developed in the story. ""It"" is destroyed by means I only understand vaguely. Something about the power of love, friendship, and childhood imagination mixed in with some preordained knowledge and ability given to the protagonists The Losers by the mysterious Turtle and ""The Other"", forces themselves that I felt were left largely unexplained.

Oh yeah, and that weird scene with underage group-sex that was supposedly necessary to unite The Losers once more or something like that was well...yeah...seemed pretty weird and random.

327,"Donna Tart's The Goldfinch - a poor man's Dickens isn't worth a PulitzerI recently finished reading Donna Tart's *The Goldfinch* and all I can say is that I'm incredibly disappointed, to the point that finishing the book left me with that hollow feeling of ""... wait, that's it?"" I haven't read anything else by Tart, but after hearing good things about *The Goldfinch* and that it won the Pulitzer in 2014 and will be getting the movie treatment, I thought I'd be sold on this book. Turns out it was actually one of the most frustrating reads I'd experienced.

Many people have compared the book to a modern-day Dickens novel, but anyone who has said that must have read very little Dickens. One of the best parts of Dickens' stories is that they all feel very tight and complete -- most actions have direct consequences and most characters that are mentioned end up coming back and playing a key role, typically in part due to a twist. Dickens often also used his books in order to provide a commentary and critique of the contemporary moment in which it was written.

Compare that to something like *The Goldfinch.* Characters are introduced which have no real meaning or influence on the plot despite seeming important. In fact, almost every character is like this. The doorman at Theo's original apartment, Pippa, who Theo falls in love with (despite having no real chemistry) and who just rejects him throughout the book, the entire Barbour family who disappears in the final act (including Theo's fianceé Kitsey who he just leaves in the middle of their engagement party and then never talks to again for the rest of the book). I could go on, but there are so many loose threads that just don't end up with any conclusion, let alone a satisfying one. The only character who comes back in the end in a significant way is Boris, who I admit is at least pretty interesting.

Boris' arrival and the climax of the book, however, reveals the entire main conflict driving the story to be a contrivance. The painting that Theo steals and then feels guilt for saving for much of his life is merely returned for a large sum of money and no one gets in trouble for stealing it... Something that should have been done *ages* ago. It makes no sense and makes everything feel hollow.

When the book finally does end, rather than wrapping things up in even a remotely neat fashion, it pretty much just has Theo ramble on for pages about his depressing outlook on life, wherein Tart seems to be trying to give the audience her grand life advice, which is to say, there is no real life advice worth giving. It was incredibly disappointing and made me come away from the book with no real lesson learned (of which there could have been many). I suppose she may have been going for a Prodigal Son-type story with Theo and Hobie, but it's a bit of a reach.

I know I've been very critical of the book here, and not all of it was bad. But I just cannot fathom how a book with this many issues and this poor of writing won a *Pulitzer* and got compared to *Dickens* consistently. Anyone else feel similarly? Or am I in the minority?",0

There is no true ending to the story you've just spent a few hundred pages on. It just stops.

I have a few theories on the book, if you have read it too and understand it better, can you tell me if any of this is correct or maybe can explain it better?


**Warning this next part contains spoilers.**




---------------------------------------------



(Spoilers!)


&gt;!**Theory #1**:
The main character is depressed, and to cope with such depression has recessed into the deep wells of his mind. Recreating within' it the world around him. But all of the characters in his mind are just figments of his own consciousness and as a result they do not, they cannot love nor show emotion back. They simply *are there*, playing back responses, interacting with him. **The Town** offers him this comfort, a tranquility free of rejection and free of all of the mishaps of life. His **Shadow** is his real self, dying away but yearning to experience life. However the **Gatekeeper** is his depression, severing the ties between the two and keeping him locked away in his own downwards spiral. At the end, when he lies back in his car it is to my best guess that he then takes his own life.!&lt;

---------------


Now normally I'd go home with this theory, but then I can't help but feel this story is a double-edged sword and slices two stories in one. Here is yet another theory of mine.


--------------------------------------------------------------


(Spoilers!)
&gt;!**Theory #2**: The main character lives in distant future that has been consumed by war, fed up with devastation **The Town** was created. With its creation it sought to solve humanity by separation of **The Mind** (emotions, memories, drive, etc). Without this, there would be no more conflict and The Town would live peacefully forever. So what is **The Shadow** then? Take this with a grain of salt, but I believe in order to live within' The Town one must become an android. Functionally identical to your real self, flesh and all, experiences consciousness, pain, and might even live forever. But with it comes a price, you are split in two, and you feel no emotion as an **Android**. Your **real self** is really **The Shadow** and your Android then goes on to live in The Town. Since you cannot really experience emotion, only figments of emotion, you rely on your shadow. But as a shadow is only human, it will die, taking with it memories, emotions, and everything that matters.!&lt;


----------------------


&gt;!Why did I come up with Theory #2? The Gorilla with a human brain and a quote from the protagonist himself ""Was this body really mine?"". Along with several other key lines in the book that point towards this being a real possibility. Of course both theories are nowhere *near* perfect so bear with me.!&lt;

336,"Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground is the best depiction of anxiety I've readI started reading it this morning and am only halfway through the book and it's already one of my top books despite being one of the shorter Dostoevsky novels.

The way he is self aware, yet perfectly explains the thought process of someone with anxiety. Wishing you could maintain eye contact with someone and then get mad at yourself when you're always the first to break it. Thinking everyone around you must see your flaws as you do and so you separate yourself from them as to not inconvenience them with your presence all while being envious of their acceptance of their own flaws. Holding grudges for years against someone who likely doesn't even know you exist just because they inconvenienced you. The way he jumps from subject to subject because your thoughts are always scattered.

​

Then the sense of entitlement. Since your anxiety controls you, a social life doesn't exist or the relationships are short lasting and so you resort to reading. Because you're so well read and everyone is off being social, you assume you're more intelligent than everyone else.  Which snowballs the anxiety because you can't imagine socializing with someone who isn't as enlightened as you. You have to maintain this facade because it's the only positive thoughts you have.

​

This book is hitting close to home because I went through similar feelings during my 20's and into my 30's. How could people do that to ME? How dare they be disrespectful to ME! Everything everyone does is intentional because everything I do is intentional. The reason people don't get me is because I'm just too enlightened.

​

Took me a long time to realize I'm not that important and anything I thought I've done doesn't mean shit. No one is going to remember the political discussions on Facebook where I thought my opinion was superior. No one is going to remember the tons of hours I spent crafting arguments on social media and getting SO worked up and then deleting the comments because I worried about how people portrayed me. No one cares and people don't think about me as nearly as much as I think they do.

340,"Just finished Norse Mythology by Neil GaimanHey y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm on a Neil Gaiman marathon right now and I'm just going through the books that I currently have. I recently finished ""American Gods"" so I was still in the mood for more Norse-esque storytelling. So I decided to read this book next and I was not disappointed. I knew little to nothing about Norse Mythology (other than the Marvel movies, but even then they change A LOT of things), I thought this was real user-friendly and Gaiman really simplified it in a way that was both interesting and captivating. I could not put this book down, if I wasn't in school or at work, I'm reading Norse Mythology. I started the book roughly a week ago and I can't believe how fast I got it done. It was so bizarre yet fascinating, so strange yet satisfying. By far, Loki is my favorite character in all of Norse Mythology but not for one second would I have my back turned on him.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I can't wait to keep reading more Gaiman books. Last time I checked, the next one on the list is Anansi Boys. Also wanted to know what did y'all think of Gaiman's Norse Mythology? Where would you rank it in Gaiman's standard of writing? Also if you're reading this, I hope y'all have an amazing day!",0

342,"Just finished ""American Gods"" and I feel robbed of a good story.When I learned about the premise of this book, I was immediately hooked on the concept. A world built around gods being real and there are power struggles among them... Well that's what I expected anyways.

First I want to point out that yes I understand there was a hidden meaning under the story. With that being said, it's hard to care about that when I couldn't get attached to the story being openly portrayed. (I actually didn't even know there was a hidden meaning until googling the book after I read it). 

 The main character just seemed to be not emotional invested in anything happening. ""Oh my wife dead, oh well, I guess I'll go drink this one guys mead and work for him"". ""Oh he wont tell me anything about this insanity going on around me, oh well, I guess I'll go over here now"". He just seemed so dull in such an amazing world. My favorite parts had to do with everyone but the main character. 

I loved the world but couldn't stand main character and I wish there were multiple books in this universe portraying different people.",0
343,"Picking up reading as a hobbyHello people,

I always wanted to read books. I have read a few books and found myself wondering if I am doing it the right way. I mean, How to actually read a book rather than flip through the pages. What should I look for when I pick-up a book? How to differentiate a good book from a bad one?(Is there a thing called bad book?) 

Any thoughts on this would be highly appreciated.",0

347,"Borrowing e-books from a library in another country?I recently got myself an e-reader (which I LOVE by the way) and have run into a bit of a problem. I usually borrow a lot of books from local libraries since I'm just a student with not much of a disposable income to talk about.

The problem is, where I live (in Greece) there is pretty much no such thing as an electronic library. I'm reasonably certain that not a single library lends e-books.

So my question is this. Is there any way for me to borrow e-books from libraries in the USA (or another European country I guess, as long as the books are in English)? Because otherwise my favourite hobby just became a lot pricier...

Looking forward to everyone's suggestions!",0
348,"Book with most impact on you?I feel as though every book has at least a small impact on me as a person, in shaping my beliefs and thoughts. I’ve always felt this way but recently I finished Demons by Fyodor Dostoevsky. I have not stopped thinking about it since. It literally revolutionized my perception of morality, has me questioning my philosophical beliefs regarding the meaning and purpose of life, and even my political beliefs. Dostoevsky does such an amazing job writing for both sides in his books that even though we know where he stands, his characters he creates to oppose himself are also awfully convincing. 

Anyone else have a similar experience with a book? A book that hit you like a train and really changed and effected you?",0
349,"What are your thoughts on modern epistolary formats (text, social media, IM, emails)?In particular, novels that utilise text messages, instant messages, social media and emails to tell the story. A good example is Lauren Myracle's 2004 novel '[ttyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ttyl_(novel))' and the ensuing sequels. Personally, I can't stand it. It's got an uninteresting story and one-dimensional characters. I can, however, appreciate Myracle's contemporary and experimental story-telling format. It isn't exactly rich in prose but there's something exciting and voyeuristic about reading these types of modern epistolary novels that I imagine would appeal to the social-media-crazy adolescents and young adults of today.",0
350,"Southern Gothic authorsHey all, I'm working on a personal project to map out Southern Gothic authors and began assembling a list - and while I know of and/or have read a fair amount of the big ones like Flannery, Poe, Faulkner, Harper Lee, Cormac McCarthy or Truman Capote - I quickly realized I have zero knowledge of many others. And while I still want to compile a good list, it also seemed like a good discussion point for a post here. 

To take from the [Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Literature](http://literature.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-304#) *Southern Gothic includes the presence of irrational, horrific, and transgressive thoughts, desires, and impulses; grotesque characters; dark humor, and an overall angst-ridden sense of alienation. While related to both the English and American Gothic tradition, Southern Gothic is uniquely rooted in the South’s tensions and aberrations.*

The good ole' [Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic#Authors) (below) seems like as good a place as any to start, but I'm wondering if anyone here thinks there are any glaring omissions, or included authors who don't stand up to the rest. For example, I can see an argument being made to include Stephen King for *The Green Mile* and a lot of the themes he uses in his novels. Or even something like *Annihilation* by Jeff Vandermeer, which is of course sci-fi, but also falls in pretty well with a lot of the staples of Southern Gothic and is in the American South, but I'm sure it's also a question of whether or not Southern Gothic makes up a substantial enough portion of the authors work to lump them in with that genre.

351,"Crying at A Thousand Splendid SunsI just finished A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Housseini. It was on all the top sellers list in 2007, so I'm kinda late reading it. I don't usually cry at books. I heard it was sad, so I thought maybe, at most, I'd get a little misty eyed. But it was so much more. I broke down sobbing at the end. My life is so cushy and easy compared to these poor women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. I had to call my mom after reading and discuss it with her. She asked, ""Is it a true story?"" I suppose it could be.

352,"Library Book Club KitsI've seen a few posts on this sub recently regarding book clubs/starting book clubs.  

This bit of info may have been mentioned in one or more of those threads and I just may have missed it, but in case it wasn't already shared I thought I'd mention it.  If you are thinking of starting a book club and the members are on a limited budget, you may want to check out your local library system to see if they loan out ""Book Kits.""  These are kits specifically put together for book clubs.  My local library is super small and it does not have these kits in it's immediate inventory, but they can be requested from a much larger library through our library system.  If it's something you are interested in and your local library does not have them available, I would suggest asking your librarian if there are options to interloan these kits.  I could not believe it when I saw that there are dozens of these kits and the range of genres and authors were quite impressive.

Here is a general description of what is included in these Book Kits:  'These kits, containing 8-15 books, discussion questions, author information, reviews, and read-alikes, are available for checkout. Each kit checks out for six weeks and cannot be reserved in advance for a specific date.'

I realize this information may be common knowledge for most people on this sub, but I just discovered this and thought it was something that may be helpful to share.  :)",0

Now that I've finished, I began the Hulu series last night. I have to say, I'm disappointed and not a fan of James Franco playing Jake Epping. Such a miss-match. Given the small differences in the show vs the book, my guess is that Franco was chosen not only to add publicity but to add an aspect of humor to the story line. Gotta do what ya gotta do to bring a book to the big screen I guess. I'm doing my best to ignore Franco and appreciate the ways in which they portray the 1960s setting and each step of Jake Epping's journey.  ",0

356,"What are some books that have challenged your opinions?Recently I’ve become a fairly avid reader. I used to not read whatsoever in my free time and now I read about a book a week. I’ve found that I generally gravitate towards non-fiction and find myself reading books that align with my personal beliefs (particularly politics). They help me to understand my views, but don’t necessarily challenge my worldview. Right now I’m reading the God Delusion by Richard Dawkins because I was curious about it. Certain parts of it challenge my worldview, but generally it’s somewhat of an echo chamber for me. I was wondering if anyone here has read a book that has challenged their worldview and what the impact of that book was for them, if it had any impact at all? It doesn’t necessarily have to be about religion or politics. Also I consider myself to be very liberal, and I enjoy reading about politics, so if anyone had any reading suggestions that would either challenge me and or give me insight to the other side of politics I’d really appreciate that! But, it doesn’t have to be about politics or religion, just something you think might challenge my perceptions! Thanks for the replies!",0

361,"I just finished reading The Outsider by Stephen KingThe book had interesting characters and served as a nice detective novel with the investigation but fell short with the main premise of the store: The Outsider. While I liked the characters and character interactions, HollyxRalph, I felt the supernatural stuff was weak and unoriginal. The ending also felt like a rushed movie that had blown through its budget and they had to wrap it up.

For reference, this is the first book I read by King as I've only experienced his stories through the movies. I very much liked the way he described every scene with much detail, which makes it easier to picture the story as it unfolds.",0

363,"The Three Questions by Leo TolstoyI'm not so sure how to refer to this wonderful work by Tolstoy.  A short story, or more a proverb to live by!

It is a wonderful telling of an emporer who seeks out the answers from a wise hermit to what he deems are life's most ultimate questions.  It's a quick read and quite a worthwhile one!  On more than one occasion it has made me tear up, maybe not so much from the words nor the story, but from memories it brings up or values it instills.  Highly recommend it, especially if you have a spare five or ten minutes!  Its also an incredibly wonderful introduction to the beautiful prose of Tolstoy if you have never read his work before!  If you do read it for the first time I was wondering what thoughts it brought to you?  If you've read it before what do you remember thinking about or how has it impacted you?  It definitely brings up thoughts of regret as to what was important to me at different stages of my life.

CJ Box is a go-to for me when it comes to an easy but engaging read that I can burn through while traveling or between books.

368,"Feelings on 'New Adult'?Hi all,

I'm currently studying and doing some research into 'New Adult' and whether or not there is an audience for it. It's books that are aimed for people who read YA but older in terms of 'voice' and 'tone'. When a 17yo is sobbing her heart out over her first break-up - yes, it's world-wrecking and I'm going to read it.

But what about your second heartbreak? Or your third? What about the 22 year old rogue taking on the king and taming dragons?

I think there's a growing dissonance between Young Adult and Adult literature. Young Adult was defined as transitional between Children and Adult but I'd argue that it has become its own category of itself. I love that it spans genres, I still love YA - but I'm wanting more than first love/fifteen year olds taking on the king. I love Adult - crime, romance, fantasy, history etc - I'm all over it - but I'm also looking for that section after ""high school"" but before ""family"" or ""settling/putting down roots"". A lot of adult fiction seems to tend to take place AFTER the ""settling"" - usually examining the decisions made that led up to the ""settling"".

Moore's writing was straightforward and devoid of unnecessary description, unrealistic dialogue, etc.   Plenty of good action and tension.  
I particularly enjoyed the implicit critique of capitalism/class hierarchy/consumerism that suffuses the plot.  The world of the novel has the feel of a potential dark near future America, ravaged by climate change and a wealth divide that both deeply impoverishes the marginalized, and pulls everyone with any income into a vortex of pointless consumerism.  We could be there in 10-20 years on our current trajectory. Seems like a good fit for fans of China Mieville, Paolo Bacigalupi, William Gibson, etc.

379,"I'm looking for a book reading app, but not an app for reading booksWhat i'm trying to find is an app or software that will do the things that Goodreads does (let me rate books i've read, have multiple shelves like ""to be read"" or ""books to re-read"" or genre shelves, etc. But i also really want to be able to save quotes for each book, thoughts or ideas for each book, perhaps highlights, etc. Kind of like a mini journal to go along with each book. Also, i read ebooks on my kindle app and in iBooks, as well as physical books. So adding copy and paste quotes from an ebook and photo captured quotes from physical books would be awesome.

I'd prefer an IOS app for iPad, but i'd use an app i can run on my Mac if there isn't such an IOS app.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Am i crazy for trying to find such an app?",0
380,"How to read self help books?Books like 7 habits of effective people, Power of Habit, Grit and books of that nature have a lot of material to digest. 

My grandpa told me that I should underline and make notes on the pages of the book to help me analyse and get the material into my head.... I also thought of making a separate notebook for the same reason. Self help books have helped me quite literally change my life by 180 degrees. Let me know what techniques you guys use! ",0
381,"RIP Kate Daniels series, what are some of your favorite parts? Also what do you hope will happen?Just read through all my favorite parts, last book comes out at midnight. The feels are real ): 

Things I would love to happen - 

1. In the last book we had parts of Kate coming into her power which in turn makes her feel more like her dad, but I really love those parts. I want to see her fully step in to her potential. 

2. Some acceptance from Nick - you shit I love you, You have every reason to hate Kate but I would love to see a semi sibling moment 

2 a. Mention or discussion of Greg between them? Such a messed up relationship ( Ilona Andrews does character and motives so well ) 

3. Hugh SHE SEE YOU AS A BROTHER !!
3a. Give Kate the sibling she always wanted

382,"Should I just start a different book?Before I start, no this isn't a ""I don't like this book"" type thing. I actually like the book that I'm currently reading.  My problem is that I have taken a long time to read it. The previous books I read took only about a week each if even that. However I've been reading this book, Gateway, which isn't even that long, for almost a month now. I can go days without reading a single page and sometimes I will start reading and then just stop before finishing a chapter. I'm not sure if it's just I'm interested more in other things at the moment and not generally reading as much or I just can't get back into it. The other thing is I've been eyeing another book for a while now and am ready to read it after I finish my current book. The problem is if I am in a funk of reading then that too may also take forever if I ever finish, and then I don't know if I will end up finishing my current book. What would you do in this situation? Just start the next book and maybe come back to the current one at some point or wait it out until I eventually finish the current book?",0

384,"John Dies @ The End by David WongWow what a crazy book. I really liked Wong’s (actually Jason Pargin’s) writing style, it reminded me a lot of Chuck Palahniuk - very snarky and vulgar. I thought the storytelling was excellent, really keeping me hooked until the end. One problem I had though was the extremely misleading title! I was waiting the whole time to figure out how John would die and then he doesn’t, it was actually Dave who ended up ‘dead.’ What’s up with that? Also, has anyone read the sequel? I found myself getting a little tired of all the ridiculousness towards the end and I’m wondering if it’s worth the read... ",0
385,"Knut Hamsun's Hunger made me feel like I was going to have a panic attack. Any books ever impact your mental state like that?First off, I feel like Knut Hamsun's *Hunger* is a massively overlooked novel. I could be wrong, it might be widely read; but, in my own experience talking to people, everyone seems to know Kafka, Dostoevsky, etc, and nobody I've ever met has read *Hunger*. A real shame since it's such an incredible book.

Anyway, read this one years back in rainy downtown Portland. The way he's dealing with starving, and refuses to accept any help, gave me such anxiety. I walked around, feeling isolated, then fell into a deep depression for about a month. Every time I would pick the book up and read it, I felt a bit like I was losing my mind. I'm not sure what the hell it was about this book, but no book has ever impacted my mental state like *Hunger*.

Any books ever impact you in such a way? What books? Any idea what it was about the book that impacted you?",0
386,"Lou Berney—Amazing Crime FictionI know he's a bestselling author, but I would have never heard of him were it not for some random research I was doing. I thought I'd mention his books as they are exceptional in the genre. Gutshot Straight and Whiplash River are a series starring an ex-con named Shake. Gutshot Straight starts out with Shake getting out of jail and trying to get his life together. Of course it doesn't turn out to be easy for him, and what ensues is equal parts caper, traditional mystery/thriller, and even has a meet-cute sort of romance that is not at all trite or cheesy (as they so often are). I would say the books are similar in a lot of ways to some Elmore Leonard novels, although the characters are much less wooden. Great plotting, great dialogue, really just fun-ass crime fiction at its finest. The Long and Faraway Gone is a different prospect altogether, although equally fine. The fact that Berney put this out between his two highly commercial novels shows how versatile he is as a writer. TLaFG is a much more somber work that jumps between several POVs. The prose and plotting are still eminently readable and engrossing, but the themes it tackles are much more serious than Gutshot and Whiplash. Berney's latest, November Road, is slated for October 2nd and I personally can't wait to read it.",0
387,"Anyone else a fan of The Story of My Teeth by Valeria Luiselli?I'm a big genre reader and probably would've never picked this up had it not been recommended to me... that being said... I LOVED it. 

Certainly a book not driven by plot or genre, but Valeria Luiselli is an ALL STAR. For what it's worth, she was selected in the top 5 under 35. You can tell she's flexing her muscles a little in this book... but that's what made it for me. So authentic and original (and was translated from spanish to enlgish w/ Luselli's help.) 

That being said... I've recommended it to a few of my close reader friends and haven't received the same feedback. I keep hearing that it's 'too out there' ... and while I understand that... that aspect is what made me love it. Idk. Has anyone else read it? What are your thoughts?",0
388,"Robin Hobb's Elderling Universe and feelings of deflationWarning: this is going to be a long one.

I've just finished Assassin's Fate by Robin Hobb, after slowly working my way through the entire Elderling Universe over the past year or so. I often see Robin Hobb applauded as one of the finest writers in the world of fantasy at the moment, and she's quite unusual from a series-style perspective due to the fact her series follow intertwining characters over a number of separate 'cycles'.

I suppose what's prompted me to write this post is that I personally haven't particularly enjoyed the Elderling Universe, and I'm struggling to put my finger on why. Reading reviews for the books once I've finished, and seeing reviews on here, shows that the majority of people seem to be raving about it, but I truly don't understand why.

Spoilers ahead.

Let's start with the Liveship Traders. I wasn't too fond when I first read this, however found it stood up much better on a re-read. Out of the Elderling Universe, I probably enjoyed this one best, including the characters. While it's a lengthy series, it generally had enough going on to keep it interesting. My main dislike of the series, and an issue that I have with all of Hobb's books, is that she spends all this time developing her villains, then dispatches them in unbelievably unsatisfying ways. Kyle Haven, who was probably one of her most relatable villains, was killed off in the middle of a battle by accident, without ever facing comeuppance for what he'd done to his wife and family. It upset me that she'd spent the time building up the character and developing him in increasingly worse ways, only to get rid of him conveniently with no real closure. On a positive note, the development of Althea and Malta as characters was very satisfying and thoroughly enjoyable. 

Moving on to the Rain Wild Chronicles, which is the main 'related' series to the Liveship Traders. By far the weakest of the entire universe, this series read like a bad YA outing (coming from someone who doesn't mind an occasional foray into the YA group). Unbelievably repetitive and dragged out into four books, the entire thing was about who would mate with who and who should be in charge of the pairing. That aside, another decent villain, Hest Finbok, finally reaches a stage where a good stand off should be imminent, and gets eaten by a dragon which nobody else sees happen or knows about! It was maddening.

Onto Hobb's main event- the life and development of Fitz and the Fool. A bastard prince &gt; turned kinda-assassin &gt; whining man and a character-swapping prophet who uses the other to change the events of the world. I stuck with the series, I really did, but just found it to be one disappointment after another. 

Contrary to the majority of opinions I seem to see, I really did not like the character of the Fool. He consistently used Fitz with often zero explanation as to why, and acted like a petulant child when Fitz (rightly) became frustrated with him. The other, main side of his character is Amber, who appears as a character mainly in the Liveship Traders series. I found her to be even worse, in the sense that she had all of the Fool's worst traits with seemingly no nice ones. 

In terms of Fitz, he consistently manages to make his situation worse through the entirety of his life, with only a few short respites. I don't think I've ever read such a downtrodden character. He makes multiple poor decisions the entire way through then sits feeling sorry for himself for the majority of the time. Again, his story is very repetitive and the get swathes could be cut out with no actual loss to the plot of the main story.

Specifically about Assassin's Fate, as it's the final book in the instalment and the one that's prompted me to write this post, I rarely feel so deflated at the ending of a book. The entire three books of this series focus on Fitz trying to build a relationship with his daughter, followed by trying to rescue his daughter from a situation that the Fool has put her in. The Fool in this series was infuriating- considering that Fitz is supposedly his closest friend and his 'other half', he repeatedly hurts him with no regard for the effect that he's having. The main thing that stuck out to me was his complete disregard for Fitz's feelings when insisting that Bee is his daughter; it felt uncomfortable and needless. Assassin's Fate was interesting in the sense that it brought together characters from each area of Hobb's Elderling Universe, and to some degree I enjoyed the way she tied the characters in. But some new characters seemed incredibly unnecessary to add, and the book dragged on for far, far too long. 

As per my previous comments, the actual rescue of Bee and destruction of the Servants and Clerres was the build up for three books, then over within maybe 30 pages. What?! The reader doesn't even see the majority of the finale because they're bystanders! 

In relation to the ending itself, Fitz returns to the place that his King, Verity, dies at the end of the final book after carving and putting his awareness into a stone dragon. Fitz begins to carve his Wolf, after his Witted companion Nighteyes, with the intention of doing the same as Verity as he's slowly dying from a poison administered by the Servants. I guess I saw the ending coming from a long way off, but it doesn't stop it being any less upsetting. I just can't believe that the entire final series is one frustrating mess after another, only for Fitz to die without seeing any of the benefit of what he's done. 

I'm sure that to anyone reading this, I come across as absolutely hating Robin Hobb as an author and everything she's ever written. I'm keen to stress that I don't; I wouldn't have continued with the universe if I didn't believe it had potential. However I feel like I was constantly sticking with it because I was thinking it would get better, and just found that it didn't. I felt that on the whole, with the exception of a couple that I really enjoyed, it had potential to be fantastic but in reality it was only...okay. 

If you've stuck with this rant this long, then thanks very much. I'd love to hear other's thoughts on it, either in agreement or against mine. Please- give me another perspective! I feel like I'm going mad when I read the Goodreads reviews!",0
389,"Tired of obnoxious, uninteresting book advertisements.On Reddit I get ads for books every now and then. This isn’t really a problem, but i’m getting fed up with the way these books are advertised. A couple months ago there was an ad for a graphic novel with the headline “Stephen King meets Harry Potter” or something along those lines. And now i’m seeing an ad for a book that is “Mad Max meets Game of Thrones.”

Their strategy is not to describe the genre, or some basic elements of the story/world, but to *directly* compare it to other successful works. This does not interest me at all in reading the book being advertised; it gives me the impression that the book is unoriginal and halfassedly panders to fans of a more popular work. It’s inevitable that people are going to compare similar books/series, but why use that as your headline that is supposed to get people interested? Why would i want to read something that is, for all I know, a shameless ripoff of something I like?",0
390,"Which one of you bitches is my mother?\^ that's the line that closes the first chapter of Shirley Conran's *Lace*.  In the 1980s, four successful career women are invited to meet with a young actress, ostensibly for something to do with their careers.  They're actually there to answer her question; ""Which one of you bitches is my mother?"". \* Suc\*h a quotable line.  The story then flashes back, to the teenage years and growing-up of Kate, Pagan, Maxine, and Judy, and of the actress, Lili.  The four potential mothers met as teenagers and all had the potential to become pregnant.  Potential spoilers beyond this point.

​

I'm about a third of the way through and, so far, I think the book is about freedom, specifically the freedom after the second world war, specifically in Europe, specifically for women, and specifically for these four women.  So far, I've seen Maxine and Judy's stories.  The former opens her own business, becoming more successful than her husband, and I love their relationship.  It's balanced; she spends so much of her time in charge that it makes sense that their relationship balances that out sexually, with him being more dominant while she is more submissive.  Because of the open talk of sex and sexuality, the book became famous and was also dismissed as a 'bonkbuster', as women's fiction ('chicklit'), and a precursor to novels like 50 Shades of Grey.  I admit, I haven't read the latter, but from what I've heard, *Lace* has a more accurate and more responsible portrayal.  It's loving and playful.

​

Judy works in the fashion industry, which underwent a massive boost after the wartime rationing was reduced.  Suddenly, women who had been cutting down their husbands suits had money and freedom and designers had fabric to play with.  Again, the growth of this industry in post-wartime reflects the post-war freedom of women, as they expanded into new areas and had the option of having careers alongside or instead of husbands.  Her designer friend says to Judy, at one point, (paraphrased, cba to find the quote) ""We did think you were young, but you could be in charge of a little baby at 23, so why not a little business?"".

​

The four potential mothers were born into a world where women always had careers (again, war), where it was normal to live outside the home.  They didn't know, as little girls, that that was new and unusual.  It reminds me of a section in Geri Halliwell's biography, when she describes where 'girl power' arose from.  For English women born in the '70s, Margaret Thatcher was prime minister and a woman was on the throne.  They didn't know it wasn't normal for women to be in charge.",0

392,"I finished Stephen King’s 11/22/63 last night. I’m still shaken up.This book is unbelievable. I think I took 4 or 5 days to finish it, but I think this book is best savored rather than binged.

I loved every single page of this ridiculously well-written story. Characters floored me. Dialogue floored me. The *story* floored me. I don’t give a singular shit if the historical accuracy isn’t there; I’m an American and I read this strictly as fiction. In my eyes, the people who write off this book because they disagree with King’s interpretation of the assassination are fools.

And dear God, that ending. Yeah, I’m a guy who sheds tears a lot—I mean a *lot*—while reading or watching. Just recently, I probably cried during like 3 or 4 movies. And during this book, my cheeks were soaked during the performance of *Of Mice and Men.* It was such a heartwarming and simultaneously heartbreaking moment. Maybe I’m wrong, but I also saw it as a little foreshadowing for this ending. Now, for the ending itself. I didn’t cry at all. I have no idea why. The opposite of George, I was dry-eyed in those final pages but not so during the rest of the book. It was so weird, I can’t explain it, especially considering that the ending was incredibly heartbreaking and should bring anyone who resonated with this story to tears.

This is the best book I’ve ever read. Now that I’m finished with it—it’s the morning after—I have no idea where to go next. I know I’m going to read another one of King’s books, but just the thought that there won’t be another chance for Sadie and George will haunt me for a while, I think.

Thanks for reading my rant.",0

395,"Just finished Louis de Bernieres’ “Corelli’s Mandolin”. I’m absolutely blown away.I was really sad to see there hasn’t been much discussion of Corelli’s Mandolin here, so I decided to start my own!

First off, I want to hand it to de Bernieres for covering a somewhat obscure time period in such vivid detail. I’m a history buff and I knew next to nothing about the Greek campaign in WWII, but I have a crystal clear picture of Cephallonia in my mind. 

The writing is beautiful and so clever, from heartbreaking passages of warfare to a chapter narrated by The Duce himself. There were times that had me close to tears and times where I couldn’t stop laughing. I loved all the characters - Corelli, Pelagia, Iannis, Carlo - and enjoyed every second of writing that immersed me in their lives. 

Also, de Bernieres wrote love and pining better than any author I’ve ever read. 

I know some people complain about the ending, and I didn’t love it either, but this is still a 5 Star book for me. What are your thoughts?",0
396,"Which director would you like to adapt which book?I love to think about this. Just going over in my head, how a movie adaptation of a certain book would look like if a certain director directed it. I have a few suggestions:

**The Glass Jar** - *Greta Gerwig* It would probably play out like a darker and slower, less extroverted version of Lady Bird.

**The Secret History** - *Vince Gilligan* He's never directed a movie before and I might be biased, being a huge fan of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. And I have heard that Donna Tartt doesn't want it to be adapted, ever. But hey, one can dream.

**Norwegian Wood** - Sofia Coppola. Yes, I know there is already an adaptation of this one. Yes, I know not all her movies are great. Yes, I know I'm once again biased because Norwegian Wood is one of my favourite novels and Lost in Translation one of my favourite films. But imagine if she goes back to the tone of that LiT, instead of her more recent works. Having it take place in New York, maybe even present day. That'd be awesome IMO.

**The Never Ending Story** - *Hayao Miyazaki, or just Studio Ghibli in general* Fuck the attention span of children, this movie should be over three hours long. Imagine. IMAGINE!

Anyway, what books would you like to see adapted, and by which director? Be creative and unexpected. The movies don't need to be very similar to the books even. Let your imaginations run free!

Still going to see it because I love Sarah Waters (also lesbian solidarity), I just wish Tipping the Velvet were getting a high budget movie instead.

IMO one of the books that most needs a movie right now is Michael Chabon's The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay. It would be relevant as fuck and it could be done so well. [Obligatory link](https://vimeo.com/9998091) to a student film project that gets the tone right.",0
400,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the greatest books I’ve read and ever will readHey, r/books!

I just turned 14 and last Christmas, I got *The Perks of Being a Wallflower*. in that year I had read *Watchmen*, *Divergent*, *Between Shades of Gray* (another AMAZING book), and *Fahrenheit 451*, but not much else. I used to be a really big reader (like, 4 books at once), but Reddit and my phone have absolutely *obliterated* my attention span, so normally, getting into a book is kind of a big deal for me (sorry for the massive run-on sentence). I still love to read, but normally, I can only do r/nosleep and r/shortscarystories type stuff (mad respect for the folks that put out stuff over on those subreddits).

So anyway, I had asked for *The Perks of Being a Wallflower* for Christmas because I’d seen the movie a couple years before, and *loved* it. I remember that I had asked for the book a while back, but at the time, my mom wasn’t totally on board with me reading it (love you, u/YourMamaIsLovely). My language arts teacher that year (a *fantastic* guy) had talked about it and how it was his favorite book and how much he loved it so I thought that I should ask for it.

So, as I said above, my attention span is kinda short, but I started reading it on Christmas, and finished it at around 3:00 AM. That’s legendary for me. Since then i’ve only really been able to do it with *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk (one of my favorite authors), and now i’m doing it with *The Catcher in the Rye* by J.D. Salinger.

The book was so incredible. The plot, the characters, the overall emotion that it conveyed was something special. And it made me love the movie *even more* because of how great everyone did and how faithful it was to the book. It really captured the vibe perfectly. The guy who plays Percy Jackson totally nailed Charlie, Emma Watson (in my top 5 celebrity crushes) totally nailed Sam, and Ezra Miller really nailed Patrick, but he kinda nails all of his roles (*especially* in *We Need to Talk About Kevin* which is another book I want to read), but i’m getting sidetracked. Books don’t make me cry but I came real close. I already knew what happened at the end, but it was *just* as impactful as when it happened in the movie, and that’s just incredible.

Anyway, I give that book a 10/10 and definitely recommend that everyone reads it. It doesn’t matter what type of person you are, you *need* to experience that book.

I love how Palahniuk tells his stories, his pace of speaking, his mannerisms etc. Yet I remember listening to an audiobook of ""Fight Club"" a few years ago, and it really didn't resonate with me. I'm a millennial guy, so I loved - and still love - the film, but the book - even when it's read to me - falls short.

This is not the first time it happens. I listened to both Jon Ronson's podcast at Joe Rogan's back to back, just loving how the guy sees and describes the world. So I purchased his audiobook - read by him! - and again, I found myself not being able to focus.

405,"Do you actively summarize paragraphs or chapters when you read?I'd like to be able to remember more content from the articles or books I read. It seems like I forget 99.5% of everything that I read, such as the main points of an article, the broader details of a book's plotline, or concepts from a textbook that I successfully learn and understand at the time of reading but then forget with time. Even if I have the intention of retelling a story in advance of reading an article or book, I struggle with recalling details or events. My mind tries to draw upon the information that was previously collected but the details and even the broader plotline just escape me. If you asked me to read a short story and summarize this story afterwards, I would struggle to write more than one paragraph due to issues with recollection or production. I'm not sure if this problem can be attributed to poor memory (specifically recall) or if it's because I'm not actively summarizing content as I read. Alternatively, I'm wondering if recollection is a skill that needs to be trained and developed and perhaps I never worked on it when I was younger. In full disclosure, I read very little when I was younger -- maybe less than 50 books from first grade to junior year of high school.

I am curious to know the techniques that some of you employ whilst reading. Do you intentionally try to mentally or verbally summarize as you read or is it more a subconscious process that occurs in the background (but perhaps you actively trained the skill when you were younger?)?

Please note that I am aware that the majority of readers have difficulty recalling smaller, insignificant details in a book or article. That is less of a concern. My issues lie with what I feel should be a basic skill in recalling broader events such as a general plotline or the main points of an article. I either have issues with memory recall or did not develop the skill of summarization properly (which hopefully can be trained) or both. Thanks to all for posting in advance.

406,"The Stand - Stephen King. Thoughts?Finished this book not too long ago, and it’s one of those books that really leaves you thinking about the meaning of the ending. 

The way King portrayed the struggle between good and evil was very unique and complex. 

The characters introduced each had their own personal inner battle of good vs evil which was a nice parallel to the overall struggle.

And this is undoubtedly the darkest book I’ve read (although it’s probably tame by King’s standards, as far as I know, as this is my first book of his I’ve read)

Is this book commonly talked about here? Thoughts about the book/ending?",0

408,"Just Finished Lord of the Flies by William Golding and would like to discuss - Possible SpoilersLet me begin first by thanking everyone because I have enjoyed this subreddit for awhile now and have been a long time lurker and this is my first real post since creating this account and anyways I appreciate any feedback/insight you can provide.

Out of all the books I have read lately this is by far my favorite but there are some things I would like help understanding or to discuss.

Such as:

**The child with the birthmark on his face that appears to go missing the very next day on the island and the one that planted the seed of a possible ""beast"" being on the island. This was the central point of the idea of fear being inserted into the boys minds. When he was also asked during the first assembly he was silenced by the group and laughed at.**

*What I can't seem to understand is that a book where so much symbolism is found, how does this child not represent ""Ethnicity"" or other nationalities that are different from the boys. Since he did introduce us to the fear or plant the idea that we fear things we may not understand or are like us. He was even silenced and disappeared which I'm not sure if he was killed early or if the fire in the beginning killed him but it seems to me he represents the racial issues we face even today.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Next, One of the things that bothers me is the fact that we never learned ""Piggy's"" real name.** 

*I am not sure what to make of this but it disturbs me that he had no identity and was bullied the entire time on the island.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**During the last few chapters it appears Ralph is very forgetful and can't seem to recall simple things such as the fire or being rescued?**

*Was he losing his mind on the island and part of himself or is it foreshadowing of the build up to show that all logical reasoning is being lost.*

&amp;#x200B;

These are just a few of the things on my mind after reading and any insight or help to let me know if I'm way off bases would be appreciated. Please let me know what you think. Thanks",0
409,"Educated by Tara WestoverI happened to be lucky enough to be in the car when NPR had Tara Westover come on for an interview, which was fascinating and ultimately lead me to getting her book!  Educated is the story of Mrs. Westover growing up in rural Idaho with a heavy handed conspiracy theorist, survivalist father who's harsh, often times paranoid, lording over of the family came very close to creating a very differant life for Tara.  Fascinating book, especially when Tara realizes that she is actually incredibly intelligent and heads out on her own journey for education!  Really wonderful book and writing!  If you've ever dealt with harsh family situations, this book helps to put all of that in perspective.  Highly recommend this one, especially for lovers of memoirs and stories about the varied journies that life provides! ",0
410,"Just finished reading 'American Psycho' - un-believe-able!! Best book I've read in years ~Wow - seriously, if 'American Psycho' doesn't capture the ever-increasing narcisism of today's social media obsessed world, then I don't know what does. AP is a satirical view of consumerism that has led to self-consumption, all in the name of looking the part and crafting the kind of reality that marketers and advertisers tell us we need in order to be complete. I put it in the same social-conscience stream as Fight Club (which tackles the demasculation of males in today's ever-changing world that tries to say what men should be like, how they should think, how they should speak, etc.).

The quality of Bret Easton Ellis' writing is superbly clear and carries the reader from one page to the next like one of Patrick Bateman's favorite 80's songs by Whitney Houston or Sting. The killing sequences are extremely graphic and horrific, but in my opinion, none of this actually happened -- it was all in Bateman's head, which becomes apparent at the end of the novel when he realizes who he imagined killing was still very much alive. AP has been banned in plenty of countries but to focus on the serial killer aspect is shallow and misses the point this novel is making entirely: most of us aren't individuals, we're actors in a script we didn't write, searching to fill the void that marketers are telling us we have. Life today is a series of carefully constructed social media posts which, in reality, is someone else's highlight reel, and as we work towards making our own highlight reel, we find that it's almost impossible to keep up, because it's all fake BS.

American Psycho captures the essence of modernity, how we define ourselves by the brands we endorse with our hard-earned dollars, and how ridiculous it all is in the grand scheme of things. As for the serial killer part? It's open for interpretation, but in my opinion, Patrick Bateman's homicidal fantasies are his subconscious' way of trying to tear apart the world he finds himself not only trapped in, but which has consumed him in much the same way as we see it consume us.

I dare you to read this book and tell me there aren't characters in it that remind you of someone you know. That's the horrific brilliance of American Psycho. After years of piling through so many books, I truly felt like this was a diamond in the rough and I am currently re-reading it. Sorry for the rant, I usually don't post about books all that often but this was one hell of a heavyweight in a publishing machine of cheap thrillers and dirty romance.",0
411,"Wuthering Heights - Tough ReadI’ve read Wuthering Heights before and decided it was time for a reread. Just finished it last night and seriously... what the fuck is wrong with Heathcliff?!?

I know that he is supposed to be a flawed character. The whole premise of the book is to demonstrate how dark and ugly love can be sometimes. But I don’t know, I just found it hard to cheer for any of the characters to be honest. Especially Catherine and Heathcliff. They’re both just terrible people. Am I alone in this? ",0
412,"What do you guys think of Haunted by Chuck Palahniuk?I picked the book up at a second hand bookshop for €1 on a whim. Personally I didn't like the overarching plot or poetry very much, but really enjoyed the author's creativity in regards to each character's backstory; Guts and Swan Song particularly creeped me out. Yet I can't help but feel disappointed about not being able to connect with the characters themselves; I found them unnaturally horrible and unlikable. Overall, however, I kinda liked it. What are your thoughts?",0
413,"I read The Dark Tower #1, thought it was bad, so now I have no desire to follow it upA few months ago, The Gunslinger was about to come out in the cinemas. I'd heard about the Dark Tower, which King considers to be his magnum opus, and I thought it would be a great chance to start it.

I got The Gunslinger, read it all in a few days, and... I was severely disappointed. Maybe I had too high expectations, but the book was confusing, not engaging, and felt like something written without a plot. 

Just like Alice in Wonderland, it feels like things just happen randomly and the story isn't building up to an actual end. I've also read the Witcher series, and the main character also falls so short when compared with Geralt, who is far more interesting, has a much stronger moral compass, and clear motivations for his actions. Roland, on the other hand, seems 1-dimensional, just after the man in black for whatever reason. 

**TLDR: I had hopes of reading the rest of the Dark Tower, but after the first book, I don't have any motivation to do so.** What are your thoughts? Do you agree? Or does the Gunslinger not make justice to the series?",0
414,"What are your favourite middle grade books? Do you still read middle grade stories as an adult?After years of depression not letting me enjoy books, I'm having a lot of fun reading books aimed at 'children' or middle grade, whatever it is just before young adult. I feel kind of alone in this though, and there isn't much talk online about these books...but some of them are awesome! I particularly enjoyed the Darren Shan/Cirque Du Freak books as a kid, and now I'm reading The Legend of One-Eared Podkin. ",0

416,"The greatest gift I've ever received. A Copy of, ""A Study in Scarlet"" from 1914.My amazing wife found this at a yard sale several years ago, and out of the blue gifted them to me on a random Saturday of no consequence. Furthermore, it contains a foreword by Dr Joseph Bell, something my childhood edition didn't contain, who was  one of the inspirations for Sherlock Holmes.

Sherlock Holmes and Dr John H. Watson (the Samwise Gamgee of Victorian England) have been my constant companions since I was 10 years old, when my mother gave me the unabridged two volume set of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"". I've been hooked since I read, ""A Study in Scarlet"" 25 years ago.

417,"Just finished reading The Exorcist and I'm slightly conflicted.What a page turner! I finished it in two days, but could've probably read it in one day. 
I enjoyed reading it and loved the story ...
But, the writing was not what I expected. One thing were colloquialisms that didn't quite fit, in my opinion, like "" what doin"" ""whaddya mean"".
Another thing that slightly bothered me were some of the dialogues . They just didn't feel natural/real. They had a weird flow.
Then there's the Detective, all his conversations were a little jarring. Some humor between the characters  fell flat..
At other times the writing was riveting, but overall it left me with a feeling that The Exorcist is a fantastic book, but not fantastically written. Does anyone agree ?
I feel like what I'm saying is blashemy  because it's one of the most iconic horror novels of all time.

418,"Just finished 'Bonfire of the Vanities' - Wow!I don't know if i've ever read such a long novel and enjoyed it the whole way through. Sherman &amp; Kramer were such engaging characters and I loved flipping between seeing the world through their eyes, with all their imperfections and forced senses of grandeur. 

It ended a little abruptly for me but I also feel the theme and point of the book was well made by then. I also loved the parallel of the guy jumping in and punching the mayor out of the Harlem mob at the start and then Sherman punching his way out of the court protests at the end.

Secondly, damn, it still stands as one of the greatest TV shows ever created in my opinion. I have been rewatching this absolute gem over the past couple of days and it is just pure magic. Main cast is absolutely insane, from the leads to the supporting actors, everyone is just fantastic. Same to be said for Ashes. An insanely good 3 seasons which wraps up (nicely?) a story that initially wasn't supposed to be wrapped up. There are things I would change about that ending but hey its still great.

What do you guys think?

Which show do you prefer? Which era? Which team? Or do you love them both. The 80's music, the fashion, the style its just so vibrant I definitely prefer the way Ashes looks.

At the time of Ashes airing I remember a lot of backlash toward Keeley Hawes I think purely because people missed the Sam/Gene dynamic. I will defend her to the end, she is absolutely super I adore her.

I implore those of who have never seen these shows to watch them.

Some wonderful soul has uploaded both seasons of Life on Mars to Youtube just to make this a whole lot easier

436,"I'm having a hard time enjoying ""Magic for Humans"" on NetflixI think it's a good show with a good message, but I think it would be a lot better if it was done by a guy who does real magic (""real"" meaning skilled magic and not camera tricks). He uses a lot of Movie Magic and plant gags. They're pretty obvious when you see them, especially if you like and/or study stage or street magic. The stuff he does isn't just amazing, it's literally impossible. Meaning it *cannot* be done by practical means, you *need* movie magic to accomplish it. 

Personally I think it takes away from the point, and even title, of the show. These aren't just normal people reacting to a magician doing an amazing trick, these are paid actors to look like they are normal people reacting to an amazing trick. That's not magic for humans, that's magic for actors (before it gets called out, I understand that actors are in fact human, but the show represents itself as showing candid people, which it is not).

In my opinion, if someone like Shawn Farquhar or Kostya Kimlat or Shin Lim were to do the same production, I think it would be more compelling. You would get to see genuine reactions to ambush street magic from magicians who are extremely skilled, *and* receive the intended message of the show.

In the end I'll probably continue watching, but I'm having a hard time enjoying it because it seems disingenuous.",1

I couldn’t believe it.  I haven’t been this befuddled about the critical reviews since The Orville.  It was such a fun show.  

I love dark comedies and this really hit all the right spots.  Am I the only here who really enjoyed this and thought it was really clever?  Bob Armstrong is one of my new favorite tv characters and his arc was great.  The fact that the show is lovingly set in Georgia, the accents and the jokes, “it’s a Georgia peach ya’ll!”.

466,"'Stretch Armstrong and The Flex Fighters' Season 2 Review - Despite some hiccups, season 2 manages to be as fun as season 1 In this modern era of superhero stories in comic books, TV shows, and feature films, to stand out, you have to be flexible, and it helps to be colorful. Those are the major factors at play in the original animated superhero series [***Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters***](http://collider.com/tag/stretch-armstrong/), a rebranding of the classic but forgotten Hasbro toy that has not only launched wholly unique characters but also a mythology that’s all their own, all created from scratch. The creative team is comprised of industry veterans like **Victor Cook**(*Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated*), along with **Kevin Altieri** (*Batman: The Animated Series*), **Frank Paur** (*Gargoyles*), **Alan Caldwell** (*Jackie Chan Adventures*), and **Phil Weinstein** (*Hellboy Animated: Sword of Storms*). 

The first season of this show is an enjoyable throwback to 2000´s superhero cartoons, especially those based on Marvel and DC IPs, that has a neon-tinged and varied color palette, likeable leading characters and inventive technology and action sequences. Some of its faults were that the villains were lacking personality and some plot points lacked the nuance or buildup to be effective, but the final twist was set to change the status quo for season 2. I´ll try to not spoil too much in this review, but some parts also need to be spoiled, so... I´ll try my best to cover the season.

GOOD POINTS

\-Aesthetically, the show conserves the colorful visuals of its freshman year, as well as its varied and stylish soundtrack, making the technical merits appealing to just about anyone. The action scenes this time around are more creative, still utilising the combatants´ (whether it´s established characters or new ones) powers and/or abilities to create scenes worthy of an action movie.

\-This time around, some characters gets more development, like Riya, from whom we know why she sided with Dr. C, Erika, who´s know Nathan´s Girlfriend, and Rook, who´s the most important character for all the series has been building since its beginning. And episode 8 shows more about him.

\-Even with some questionable twists, it´s good to see how the story uses some themes of technology as power, and the problems it can provoke, to add some wittyness to the main conspiracy plot. Also our main team of heroes have to step up their game in order to discover Rook and his master plan by thinking more, even taking some unwanted decisions to move forward.

&amp;#x200B;

MIXED POINTS

\-The show still runs in a semi-episodic structure, meaning that some episodes are auto-conclusive, but leave a desire of more development. But given that this new season is of 10 episodes, the narrative it´s more focused on its endgoal.

&amp;#x200B;

BAD POINTS

\-The selling point for this season was the fact that our titular heroes now are the villains because they were made public enemies without being it. But for most of the season, it seems that there´s no problem with them being heroes, because few times we see people hating them. Its an underused element that could´ve make the show more compelling.

\-Some of the new developments, muhc like in season one, happen all too quickly, or with little build-up, or put into question some previously mentioned plot points, which makes me think this show needed more episodes to build its more interesting stories.

\-For the few characters that get more development, there are many that stay short on that front, like the new villains who get a quick introduction before they become bad guys/plot devices.

&amp;#x200B;

In the final episode of the season, there´s a tease for season 3, so even though [it was confirmed for 26 episodes](https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-continues-to-expand-its-award-winning-kids-original-series-for-members-worldwide), there are mre adventures coming soon. Anyway, if you wat an action series to show to your kids or to check out with a cup of corn flakes, or to watch on some rainy days, you can´t go wrong with this not-so-complex, but enjoyable series. 7/10",1

492,"What do show titles actually mean?Let’s play a game. Comment one show you know and explain what its title means, how it connects to the story or a certain character.

I’ll start:

**Orange is the New Black** - *A play on the phrase that has to do with the protagonist, Piper Champan, before she goes to prison. Her friend circle consisted of people that would often use the phrase “_______ is the new black” when talking about new popular things. Therefore, the title reflects the contrast of her persona to those of other women in prison, since orange jumpsuits are something new for her or the so called new black. She’s no longer occupied with questions of high fashion, but of how to survive in that place.*

My description might be too detailed, but you get the idea behind it.",1

498,"One Year Ago Today the Final Episode of Blood Drive AiredIt is a criminally underrated show. For those of you that don't know what I'm talking about the show Blood Drive was a SYFY series about a dystopian 1999. In this pre-millennium future LA cop Arthur Bailey joins Grace D'Argento in a cross country car race, the catch is that the cars all run on blood, not gas.

The series is a different B movie grindhouse trope every episode. A cannibal rest stop, to a madhouse controlled by the patients, to a sex plague, this show is fucked up and weird and bloody and amazing. The two leads are just stupidly hot. The subplots are even crazy. Slink, the founder of the race has to deal with constant notes from the corporation that televises the race. Bailey's partner Carpenter tries to find out what happened to his partner and ends up falling (brainwashed? You decide) for a android dominatrix. If you haven't watched the show find a way to. The season wraps up nicely and sets up a second season perfectly.

My sister and I loved Blood Drive but everyone I tell about it in real life looks at me like they are reevaluating if they need to talk to me ever again. Please /r/television you are my only hope to talk to anyone that watched this show. ",1

It's 16 11-12 minute episodes that go down incredibly fast. There's a tiny bit of continuity, but it's fairly episodic most of the time.

The main character's overly-grizzly voice grew on me and I was happy to see that they pushed him far far away from a ""Rick"" character. It did a great job distancing itself from Rick and Morty and Bojack Horseman.

Show is quick and easy, goes down fast, had several laughs along the way. Would highly recommend.",1

513,"I won't be watching the Charmed Reboot.Will you?So i started watching charmed as a kid and fell in love with it. Mostly with Alyssa Milano but hey who didn't. But i won't be watching the reboot. When i first heard there was going to be a reboot and not a revival like Roseanne and Murphy Brown got i was a little miffed but i was like ok whatever. Then i heard it was on a college campus and i was excited. Maybe our girls are now professors in college and will be training a new generation of witches. Or this might be a magical college and they are just not telling us right away.

&amp;#x200B;

I was excited.

&amp;#x200B;

But then the first description came. So the first description said that this new show was going to be a feminist show(because a show in the 90s about three independent women fighting monsters and saving the day was not feminist. and not in 2018 but IN THE 90s.) and will deal with the patriarchy (maybe thats because i am a guy but when i hear the word patriarchy i always lose a bit of respect for that person because it never follows something intelligent or well thought out. And also what do the charmed ones have to do with the patriarchy? Will it be because the majority of their villains will be men? Because same happened in the original and nobody cared but now you just seem to try to make the point that its not just a coincidence but its not demons that are evil BUT DEMON MEN AAAAAARGH)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways after that came the reaction from the original cast and how nobody got asked to come to the show or was even asked for any input. NOTHING. And then i think Holy Marie Combs said something poignant . Why didn't they do a revival. Did they think they couldn't do the same job they did 12 years ago? And i was thinking that maybe there is a bit of sexism involved in the reboot. Its already hard for actresses in hollywood after a certain age to get roles unless they still look youthful so maybe the new producers just wanted someone ""bangable"" to play the charmed ones because they thought that is why people tuned in every week for almost a decade?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And finally came the reaction from the actresses that are playing that just made me go OH HELL NO.

&amp;#x200B;

 

'But, when my character is challenged, when there is futile yet harmful noise about how we are either incapable or doomed, I will vociferously defend myself and my sisters ... I know our show will have a positive effect on so many women, youth, and anyone who is receptive to being on the right side of history.'

 

&amp;#x200B;

NOISE. NOISE. How pompous can you be to say that the OG actresses reacting to the reboot and the fans reacting along with them be NOISE. so they are essentially saying F\*\*k your opinion but watch my show and make me money. NICE. 

&amp;#x200B;

but anyways that is my opinion.Will you watch it? No ? Yes? Why will you watch it or won't you watch it?",1

533,"I watched the Star Trek TV series for the first time... and its REALLY goodSo being young enough I didnt grow up watching Star Trek but I do consider myself a huge sci fi and fiction fan. I never watch cable but I was staying at a hotel and when I turned on the TV Star Trek popped up, decided screw it I'll watch a bit

Holy cow I had no idea what I was missing. I always thought  star trek was supposed to be this super nerdy and niche show but now I understand how it's so popular. The three episodes I saw were phenomenal. I couldn't tell you the season or episode but the ones I saw were when Commander Riker gets kidnapped and you watch this man go through this crazy psychological torment and attack trying to escape his captors, it was absolutely captavating and amazing to watch.

The other episode that blew me away in the subject it touched on was when Captain Picard's simulated Professor Moriarty manages to take over the ship, ending with the crew leaving that same professor in a simulation on a desk. Somehow at the end I was once again going through the ""we could all be in a simulation"" thought process which I thought I had left behind. 

Finally I watched the episode where they basically explained how there could be so many humanoid type creatures in the one galaxy (they all were planted by one race). Not that this particular episode was mind blowing but I felt like this was the coolest and simplest way anyone has explained this phenomenon in a Sci Fi show. Dont know if others have done this but just the fact the writers thought it was important enough to warrant a whole episode I thought was pretty cool.

Now I realize to a lot of you television fans none of this is news or really that interesting but I wanted to share this story because I had never realized how good some old TV can hold up to today's standards years later. After watching those couple episodes I'm definitely going to try to find somewhere else I can watch more!

Pretty bored but still watched the whole thing.  Really didn't like the romance story, very cliche, and she just happens to be at the hospital where the action goes down.

Which means, in turn, that Frasier (the show) is a torture scenario. But who is being tortured? Martin? No way because Martin would never be in hell. Martin is a good man. 

Which leads me to the inescapable conclusion that Frasier was assigned to torture Eddie.

It doesn't need to be a super tidy bow, even Sopranos offered me satisfying closure despite its popularity as a terrible ending (i actully loved it).

Also, i like shows to have an overarching storyline, but again, it doesn't have to be super focused on continuity, i just like to feel story progression, I just like to avoid purely episodic shows.

One thing that always stands out to me is how older television acting was much closer to stage acting than the acting we have today.

If you're not familiar with the witcher books, on which the netflix series are based on, you might not be sure of how Geralt will look like. 

There are a lot of pictures circulating that make Geralt look like a grumpy old bearded guy, those are totally wrong.

Geralt is not really old &amp; not big, he's thin and well built. Henry will have to lose some weight to properly portray him.

Geralt is often found wearing leather jackets, he's known to hate any kind of beard on his face. He's much closer in appearance to Geralt from the first witcher game, rather than the third one.

As an adult, Over the Garden Wall re-kindled my curiosity.  I felt as if I were in 1st grade again, watching ""David the Gnome"" for the first time.  It contained a perfect blend of the complexities of adulthood (interpersonal relationships.  conflicts with adversaries, inherent need to protect family) along with a certain child-like light warmheartedness.

648,"What recent/current shows will be better off with a ""case of the week"" structure?On this sub I often see this type of shows vilified &amp; they are considered inferior to shows that tell one big story in one season. That is good but often I find many shows are better suited for the case of the week while the main story develops in the background &amp; leads to a thrilling season finale.

Shows like The Shield, Justified(early seasons) &amp; Person of Interest are very good examples. In the 2nd season of The shield they plan a heist but it runs in the background with 5 minutes development in each episode while they do other shit until the last episode where it leads to a superb season finale. The whole thing would have been incredibly boring if they took 13 episodes just for a heist. Why can't the big bad villains be left in the background making shady deals &amp; maybe making a terrific appearance at the half season point?

For me the most obvious shows that will improve by using a case of the week format are Sneaky Pete, Luke Cage &amp; Jessica Jones. 

In Sneaky Pete, writers should really watch the 2nd season of The shield to know how to write a good heist tv show. There are meaningless twists &amp; turns. The two leads in Giovanni Ribisi &amp; Marin Ireland have great chemistry &amp; this show can be a very capable &amp; even better replacement for something like White Collar, but is dragged down by the need to stretch one story.

Why do Netflix &amp; Amazon prime not like case of the week format? Is there some kind of study that says they won't work just as well? Does HBO really need to be copied everywhere?

Are TV shows like Justified, The Shield, Person of Interest less of a classic because of their case of the week format? I think it allows for better character development, more cool moments &amp; better season finales.

Similarly Luke Cage &amp; Jessica Jones are two other shows where I was felt like they should do something else. In the 1st or 2nd episode of Luke Cage 2nd season, the lead character dresses up in a suit &amp; goes into the club where the bad guys are meeting &amp; you think alright it is on. He walks into the club in slo-mo with live show going on goes up to the bad dudes. And the bad dudes point to the lead guy's girlfriend also in the club. And then nothing. Luke Cage &amp; his gf walk out. And I keep thinking wow this conversation could have happened over whatsapp. 

In these two TV shows would in my opinion be better off with a little less plotting. I mean Jessica Jones is literally a detective. Even the comics don't run with one story for the whole of one author's run. Why do the tv shows then?

682,"In the wake of some stellar book-to-TV show adaptations, let's not forget one of the most tonally faithful of all time: the Goosebumps TV showMy wife and I were delighted to find the TV show ""Goosebumps"" available on Netflix. Neither of us watched it when it aired originally but we both read the books and were in the mood for something corny, cheesy and easily mock-able.

While it is certainly all those things, ""Goosebumps"" is also a lot of other, WEIRD things. Let's get something out of the way; I devoured the books as a kid, often reading one in an afternoon (then rereading it) and my favorites were usually the scifi or psychological-horror ones (Cuckoo Clock of Doom, Go Eat Worms) as opposed to the creature-features (Night of the Living Dummy, Stay out of the Basement) but the big sticking point for me, as a young reader, was how oppressively *bleak* the books were. Very few have happy endings (almost none espouse a ""lesson"") and they all gleefully exploit the misery and trauma of whatever awful thing is happening to a twelve year-old over the course of 100+ pages (to the point where most of the ""plot"" could be told in a book half the size--hence the 21-minute TV show). Reading these as an eight or nine-year old, it really felt like I was getting away with something.

Which brings us to the TV show. As far as recreating the tone of its source material, it is perhaps the single greatest TV adaptation I've seen. Rather than concerning itself with being a palatable, well-paced kid-friendly show, each episode of ""Goosebumps"" just tries to recreate one book in all of its balls-to-the-wall, incomprehensible twists-and-turns glory. Just look at the first official episode of the show--""The Girl Who Cried Monster"". After finding out her librarian is a monster trying to eat her and then spending the entire episode having her parents NOT believe this, we then find out the girl knows her parents are ALSO MONSTERS and the episode ends with them eating the librarian. This, like the book, quite beautifully makes no sense. Or how about ""Bad Hare Day"", which features a protagonist so obsessed with being a magician that the episode ends with him willingly getting *decapitated* for the showmanship of it all?  TV-Y7, anyone?

Like the books, the TV show also insists on featuring REALLY wholesome families so they can just rip 'em apart. There are exceptions, but most of the episodes feature a very supportive nuclear family unit in the background bending over backward to get to the bottom of whatever supernatural terror is destroying their kid's life. ""Night of the Living Dummy 2"" centers itself around a ""family show and tell night"" for godssakes. (NONE OF THE KIDS THINK THIS IN ITSELF IS LAME). Our twelve year-old protagonists are usually polite rule-followers, voracious readers and team-players--in other words: role models. The show then proceeds to devote its runtime violently traumatizing them. It is capital-T trashy.

Every episode also has an oppressively dreadful atmosphere. Because each 21-minute episode is adapting a 100+ book, they trim out all the scenes where nice things happen and just focus on kids being absolutely terrorized.  I can only assume the cameramen had a rig built to keep the camera at a 45-degree dutch angle and there was no shortage of fish-eye lenses.  The music is just awful, dissonant midi-keyboards. And--perhaps my favorite carry-over from the books--each episode has a cold-open jump-scare followed by a commercial break. (Spoiler: when the show returns, we find out it's someone playing a prank).

I guess my point is that it makes so much more sense, especially these days, to adapt Goosebumps into a more kid-friendly format (see the 2015 film) and, you know, make it.. good? Cuz the books are BAD. (Interestingly bad, but still bad) And yet, this TV show adapts each book in the series as if it was ""No Country for Old Men"" and it produces some hilariously weird TV. My personal favorite moment has to be the end of the needlessly long ""Welcome To Camp Nightmare"" when the episode's four twists are unrolled in highly uncinematic fashion. You see, Billy thinks it's a summer camp, but it's really a government training center. We learn this as each character emerges from the woods, says their particular revelation, then joins a standing crowd awaiting the next group to emerge and reveal the next twist. (Meanwhile our protaganist stands totally still spewing out ""But what abouts..."") (Also they're not on Earth). I mean, this already doesn't work in the book. No one thought about tightening the screws here during the script-writing process?

​

Some last thoughts: This is an incredibly Canadian show. Most of the main characters are the soft-spoken, put-upon type so you get plenty of chances to hear that beautifully-accented ""sorry"". Also, not many black people in Goosebumps land, but if there's one around you can bet they are best friends with the protagonist. I'm pretty sure the books don't often specify race so this is a halfway-decent attempt for the showrunners to put some diversity in--unfortunately these best-friend characters are underwritten and do absolutely nothing. And how about that theme song?",1

710,"Ranking the 5 Actors who have played Jack Ryan so far.James Bond fans seem to get into this never ending debate over which of the 6 James Bonds is the best. And so, I thought, now that we have 5 Jack Ryans, it is probably an interesting debate too. 

So how do I rank Jack Ryan? Its not exactly an easy task, because well, Jack Ryan is a sprawling character that has been around too long, in too many books (some of which aren’t even written by Clancy himself, no seriously, Jack Ryan books are still coming out after his death). But if we were to distill early Jack Ryan down (since all the movies/show pretty much just touch on his early career), Jack Ryan is fundamentally an analyst, not an action star. He must have this bookish charm, who has this reluctance to participate in combat (and isn’t good at it at all). Since I’m trying to evaluate different actors and their take on the character, I’ll try my best to ignore film quality (just like how, I think Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond, while at the same time admitting that he’s been in some terrible movies).

IMO from best to worst, the Jack Ryan's go:

1.	Alec Baldwin.

The original and still the best, Baldwin was inspired casting for Jack Ryan. Ryan is charming, slightly awkward, and more of an analyst than an action star and you can see it. He isn’t fluid with a gun (and there was only 1 action scene in the whole movie that just happened to involve him). The great part of Baldwin’s portrayal is how he nailed Ryan’s reluctance, like Jack Ryan is brave and understands that he does what he needs to do, but there is a constant fear in his eyes (IE; the helicopter scene) when he is expected to exert himself.

2.	John Krasinski

So maybe it is recency bias talking, but Krasinski nails Ryan’s charm, and his slight awkwardness, his unwavering persistence, his ability to convince others (see the first episode with the treasury officer). But I feel like Krasinski didn’t nearly as effectively portray Ryan’s ability and a function of knowledge and experience, instead there’s too many “eureka” moments, and towards the end, he looked way too effortless in some of the chase and combat scenes. 

3.	Ben Affleck

I actually think Ben Affleck could be number 2 on this list, but unfortunately, it was his terrible script that drags him down. Affleck has charm and brings quite a bit of humor to the character, but then, the movie didn’t really put him in a good spot to bring it out. 

4.	Harrison Ford. 

Too rough, too tough, and too old are my main criticisms of Harrison Ford. And this might be due to his other works, but Ford’s charms were too rogueish and not bookish enough. Like, I just can’t buy the Fact that Ford sat behind a desk at headquarters for his day job. 

5.	Chris Pine

Honestly, Pine’s version of Jack Ryan was a disaster overall. He had terrible chemistry with Cathy, and he felt way too much like American James Bond than Jack Ryan, what with his sneaking around and the effortless action. It feels like Pine was cast in a generic action movie, perhaps a mission impossible movie, and the whole “Jack Ryan” part was just something tacked onto the end. 

So here’s my ranking, what's yours? Who do you think was the best Jack Ryan? ",1

And while I liked Brickleberry (it wasnt the best show in the world, but enjoyable) I couldn't wrap my head around why anyone would want to simply [reskin it](https://i.imgur.com/rN8mwqG.png) and release it again. The main character and the boss on each show even have the same voice actors doing the same voices. So I didn't have much hope for the show. 

But what makes all the difference to me, and why I enjoy it better than Brickleberry, is that it's **not on cable.** They can say and do things that would've never flown on Comedy Central and that gives them a lot more room to tell their best jokes and create stories. On top of that, it no longer has Daniel Tosh. And dont get me wrong, I find Tosh very funny, but his voice is so unique that when I hear it I can only picture him, so whenever Malloy talked it took me out of the show. Kyle Kinane as Bullet feels much more natural to me (similarly this has been one of my biggest issues with Eric Andre in Disenchantment).

I loved the back story of Suleiman, the action scenes were great, the production was surprisingly good, and I'm just excited for the next season.

The main things I didn't enjoy about the series was the drone pilot's storyline. My friend and I were talking about how his entire arc was just a waste of time and would have been better spent on character development for Jack, Greer, or Suleiman. Also, I didn't really enjoy how the show ended. Pretty anticlimactic. They built Suleiman up so much only for him to go down like that. I was hoping for a dramatic scene between him and Jack or at least a cliffhanger.  Lastly, I feel like 2-3 more episodes would have been a nice addition to continue the drama a bit and build some character development.

* They both lament flying a drone thousands of miles away instead of being in a cockpit as they hoped and trained for. 

* Both pilots struggle with the morality of their jobs and attempt to cope by drinking heavily, and engaging in risky behavior. 

* Their wingman (minority female) with whom they have a good/flirty relationship is less morally conflicted than them but nonetheless offers support. 

* In both the movie and the TV show, the pilots are pushed to the edge when they kill an innocent person. 

* Later, both pilots are appalled at being told to sit idly by and watch while a woman gets raped, decide to take matters into their own hands and fire at the rapist without authorization. 

* They both watch with bated breath as the woman lies motionless before eventually rising unharmed.

**** 

**How Sam Won**

Sam came into the game at 250lbs.  Sam left at 200lbs.  So, Sam lost 50lbs of fat.  

Fat has 3500 calories a pound.  So, Sam burned 175,000 calories of fat.

How many days does 175,000 calories of fat give you?

Well, assuming Sam burned around 3000 calories a day, (175,000 calories) / (3000 calories a day) = Estimated 58 days of survival.  Sam survived for 60 days.

This is how Sam won the game.  Not much else mattered.

The Paiute deadfall didn't matter.  Eating leaches didn't matter, grazing on wild plants didn't matter.  Hunting, fishing, rations, none of it really mattered when compared the the massive amount of calories fat brings to the table.

Yes, starvation is a little more complicated than simply living off your fat, but it's not that much more complicated than living off your fat.

And the harsh reality is Sam won by surviving on his fat.  Period.

****  

**The Failure to Survive**

This marks a 5^th season where there hasn't been a single contestant who was actually able to survive in the wild, in the sense of the word 'survive'.  Honestly, if you were to ask me who would most likely win this show, fat Oprah or SAS Bear Grylls, I honestly don't know.  As it stands right now, the perfect contestant for Alone is an outdoorsy morbidly obese individual under the age of 30, because all you really need is to build a shelter, make a fire, don't hurt yourself and have the will to stay out there. 

Ever heard the story of [Ishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishi) the last wild native American?  He lived on his own for years.  

What about [Alexander Selkirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Selkirk)?

How did they survive?

Mountain men?  Natives of all peoples?  How did they do it?

There are many other examples of individuals surviving, alone, in the wild, so it's not unfathomable, but there has been a complete failure of any individuals on the show to actually survive.  Provided there was no show and each of the individuals were truly on their own in the wilderness, all would have died within 3-5 months, and in every case, they subsisted by-in-large off of their fat stores.  This is not survival.  This is Biggest Loser  Wildland Starvation.



**** 

**Hope for the Future**

I still keep my hopes up that next season will be different.  Maybe next season an individual will be dropped off at 170lbs and will be picked up at roughly 170lbs a couple of months later.

But the nagging question is, ""How?""  How does one actually survive and live in the wild?  It is possible, but I don't have an answer to this question.

Still waiting.

783,"The Wire is still relevant even after nearly two decadeshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx3VpW8x5-w

I've been reworking my way through season 2 which I liked upon my first viewing primarily.  But years after my first viewing, the second season has jumped up a level with its dock storyline. 

The scenes about the robots, their jobs being automated, and their reactions to them in the subsequent scenes took on a whole new meaning. I grew up in a working class area so the scene meshed with my experiences and the worries about the automation of working-class jobs upon my first viewing. Now the conversation has shifted almost entirely. People are concerned that some white collar technical and administrative jobs are in the path of their jobs being replaced by robots. Now that it's white collar jobs, it's getting more attention. 

The conversation between Frank and Bruce remains relevant as well. Bruce sends his kid off to a top of the class school, he'll go on to ""squeeze a buck"" as Frank puts it and it'll continue for the next generation. Meanwhile, people such as Frank know that their job outlooks are limited. 

Something that I continue to enjoy about those scenes and the Wire is the dialogue. I just finished season two of the Westworld and the dialogue felt unrealistic and cheesy. In the Wire, the dialogue feels like actual people are talking and not avatars for the writers to relay their ideas.  At the same time, the conversations in the Wire can be loaded with some heavy themes that are timeless. ",1

I've been a fan of the Simpsons since i saw them on Tracy Ullman in 87 and 88 when i was 5/6 and loved those shorts and i taped every episode of the show from 1989 to 2000 and the show should had DIED in 2001! It was a biting satrical show with intelligence, heart, soul, anti-authority social satire and excellence with a proper use of celebrity guest voices. Even quality writing with wit/snark/sarcasm and intelligence. I've been a fan of adult animation for a long time as i did saw some in the 80s like Rock &amp; Rule on HBO which my parents taped for me with Twice Upon a Time when i was 4 in 86 with Starchaser Legend of Orin and Warriors of the Wind aka the butchered Nausicaa then at 5 saw Fire and Ice and Wizards with Lord of the Rings and fantastic planet with my big brothers on video. I even enjoyed Liquid TV with Aeon Flux (the shorts and spin off show), The Maxx, Duckman, Spawn, Heavy Metal, Beavis and Butthead, King of the Hill, Fritz the Cat, Akira with various anime even Cowboy Bebop, Princess Mononoke and others growing up in the 90s as a kid/teenager.

I gave up on this show in 2003 and i moved on to other adult animation as the show was getting soured/stale as i feel anything past season 10 is NOT The Simpsons but Zombie Simpsons! I  you feel The Simpsons is a product of the 90s and has no place in today's world when it should had died in 2001 with Futurama as it's replacement.

The show died in 2001 to me as i quit show after 2002 and gave up when we had better replacements like Futurama. Fox aka Fucks ( a formerly great studio ran by people who care before they went for greed/caring about money more than quality just like Sony). I  bet TRUE fans of the show who grew up in the late 80s and 90s like me who gave up after 2002 or 2003 or 2004 knew it was an abomination because gone was the intelligent satrical writing/soul/emotion/heart/intelligence is replaced by a living dead corpse of a show puppeted by the greedy Fox who only cares for money than quality as Simpsons is now just another Sitcom than a meaningful intelligent show with emotion/heart/intellgence/soul as The Simpsons feel irrelevant nowadays compared to the 90s Simpsons and of course other adult animation nowadays. 

I tried to watch an episode of new Simpsons and man oh man i felt my brain was melting and wanted to punch the TV. Even seeing the Lady Gaga episode in clips nearly gave me cancer.

Yet if  the show ends next year, it's better to kill something than let it suffer for it's losing more viewers and merchandise sales are going down the drain. This show has became a wounded fatally dying soldier that was shot a bunch of times in a war field and seeping behind a building with other soldiers and is asking ""please kill me! please kill me so i won't suffer anymore"" or like a wounded half-dead animal that needs to be put down. The Simpsons had their place in the sun but since 2001 enough is enough, time to give up Fox and end this show next year! time to rest in peace, move on and done more than enough and more than enough episodes and more than enough episodes as it's becoming a joke of itself and Fox is hurting it's legacy and damaging it's legacy and i'm tired of it. I feel like Tom Atkins at the end of Halloween III with ""Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!!!!"". Plus had a good run in the 90s.

It's not only beating a dead horse, it's also beating a dead chidhood/teenhood friend friend who needs to be buried. It's now a shambling soulless unfunny poorly written husk of a show that is braindead.

SINO (Simpsons in Name Only which is post 2001) is NOT The Simpsons,  By almost any measurement, The Simpsons is the most influential television comedy ever created.  It has been translated into every major language on Earth and dozens of minor ones; it has spawned entire genres of animation, and had more books written about it than all but a handful of American Presidents.  Even its minor characters have become iconic, and the titular family is recognizable in almost every corner of the planet.  It is a definitive and truly global cultural phenomenon, perhaps the biggest of the television age.

 if you flip on FOX at 8pm on Sundays, you will see a program that bills itself as The Simpsons.  It is not The Simpsons.  That show, the landmark piece of American culture that debuted on 17 December 1989, went off the air more than a decade ago.  The replacement is a hopelessly mediocre imitation that bears only a superficial resemblance to the original.  It is the unwanted sequel, the stale spinoff, the creative dry hole that is kept pumping in the endless search for more money.  It is Zombie Simpsons.

It's better to kill this undead zombie of a show and move on! this isn't the 90s anymore as we moved on and glad the ratings are down. I hear Matt wants to pull the plug next year. Sometimes dead is better like Jud Crandal in Pet sematary said.﻿

it's no longer a relevant show anymore. Now Regular Show, Rick and Morty, Bojack Horseman, Castlevania,  Bob's Burgers, Archer or any anime for more relevant adult animation than Zombie Simpsons. Now for example, Bojack Horseman has the same heart/soul/intelligence/spirit and wit of The Simpsons (aka the REAL Simpsons), not like Zombie Simpsons.

I also feel with Conan and some of the other writers left even Phil Hartman's death, the show went downhill. The first 10 seasons had life and since 2000 it's been on life support.

But you know what as i'm a futurama and King of the Hill fan, i'm very happy and glad they ended on good notes and didn't become shambling zombie corpses as it's better to let them rest in peace and move on to make new fresh adult animation.

Now the show is a vegetable these days and unwatchable as i'm glad i stopped watching the show in 2003 and moved on to other adult animation. I even saw the awful Simpsons movie in theaters which i had been waiting years to see after hearing in magazines since 1991 about it and it should had been made in the 90s and released around there or in 2000, now that would had been one hell of a thing instead of waiting too long as it's just Zombie Simpsons The Movie.

In 2003 i finally did said ""so long childhood partner, i will miss you"" as i knew the show is dead and i moved on to cherish this show on DVD on Simpsons 1 to 10.

someone once said that being a Simpsons fan is like having a beloved relative or childhood/teenhood friend  who’s been on life support for years and you’ve accepted they’re gone so you’re just waiting for someone to realize they need to pull the plug on them

Here's a video to give you the idea:

806,"My guess on how Showtimes Kidding will runShowtimes latest original series Kidding starring actor Jim Carrey is a black comedy drama series about a Mr rogers like person named  Jeff Piccirillo a.k.a Mr Pickles ,who host a long running and successful children's  show and  a multi-million-dollar branding empire but has to struggle with bad things in his life like loss,divorce and losing control of his sanity.

&amp;#x200B;

If the show is a success and is ongoing ,I am going to give my take on how long Showtimes Kidding will run and I believe it will run for  5 seasons ,here's my take

Season 1 will involve Jeff's career while dealing with his real life struggles and a breaking point that will lead to his downfall.

Season 2 will deal with Jeff's aftermath of his  downfall and focusing on other characters and their dealings with  life especially how Jeff is planning his comeback 

Season 3 will focus on Jeff's comeback but has to face new  problems in life and making sure it won't affect it,He might also get a new girlfriend as his new love interest 

Season 4 will have Jeff trying to rebuild his life  and find a new meaning and purpose.

Season 5 which will likely be a final season will have Jeff embracing his new meaning in life despite the bad outcomes and will likely marry his new girlfriend to start  a new family.

And that's my guess  on how Showtimes Kidding will run,What do you think?

809,"Some of the best web series that flew under the radarThe humble web series lacks the legitimacy and budget of network TV and even Netflix/Amazon originals. The medium is admittedly a bit of a mixed bag. However, I reckon the very best in web series are definitely on a par with great TV and streaming in terms of sheer quality.

You may have heard of and seen popular web series like Zach Galifianakis's *Between Two Ferns*, *Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee*, *Monster Factory*, *High Maintenance*, and *Broad City*. The former two have had Barack Obama as a guest. The latter two have gone on to become successful TV shows. Nevertheless, there is a lot of good stuff that still manages to fly under the radar relatively speaking. 

Below are two of the best-written web series that haven't gotten as much mainstream attention as the ones I mention above.

[An Emmy for Megan](https://vimeo.com/266625416) - Megan Amram, writer on Parks and Rec / The Good Place, makes a brazen attempt to win an Emmy for *Outstanding Actress in a Short Form Comedy or Drama Series*. She put together a hilariously barebones submission meeting the minimum criteria for the award (6 episodes, scripted, no length requirement). And guess what -- it actually wound up [getting nominated for an Emmy!](http://www.vulture.com/2018/07/megan-amram-gets-an-emmy-nomination-for-an-emmy-for-megan.html) Some pretty solid cameos too from e.g. Ted Danson, Seth Rogen, Rian Johnson.

[The Katering Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J55vgxNaaBY&amp;list=PLZFXeozdia12APH8n9xsVNhd5qallmrz2) - A cooking show featuring two Aussies who are an intolerable foodie and a food intolerant, respectively. They play it straight but really spend most of the show making jokes at each others' expense. The two leads have impeccable comic timing and great chemistry. It's dense with humor -- it is genuinely stunning how much comedy they manage to fit in 5-7 minutes. 

Feel free to chime in what you think are the *creme de la creme* of the Web Series medium.",1

923,"The Final Say On The Matter: Michael Jackson Was On 'The Simpsons'https://uproxx.com/entertainment/matt-groening-confirmed-michael-jackson-cameo-the-simpsons/

Michael Jackson voiced Fake Michael Jackson on the show, and went uncredited.

It's the singing voice that was a soundalike, because of Michael's record deal at the time preventing him from doing the singing himself.

Anyways, HBD to MJ!

Edit: Some people don't seem to correctly recall, FOX, 20th Century Fox, Gracie Films and the cast and crew were meant to deny MJ's involvement in the episode or the soundtrack album, but it was so half-assed, it resulted in probably more confusion than it ever deserved.

A little context too, MJ and his team always denied his involvement with The Simpsons, to such an extent that the Michael Jackson Estate and Sony Music allowed the ""Do The Bartman"" copyright to be sold off by the original producer, because if they fought for the rights, it would go against MJ's wishes and confirm his involvement. Also soundalikes have been a huge point of contention within the MJ fanbase, with MJ historically using them for various reasons. It's not completely bizarre if MJ had a soundalike for his lines in this episode, as he had soundalikes dubbing him over in other projects, like Moonwalker.",1

There are other great shows out there of course but so many of them suffer from pacing problems of being overlong and stretched out for the sake of ""content"". Even what I consider to be the second best show ever, The Wire, suffers from this problem as it has some poor storylines throughout and an especially questionable 5th season.   


Nothing else reaches the consistent quality of The UK Office.

934,"September is the 'Animation Madness' month for Netflix, with an interesting lineup of animated productions to watchSeptember will be an interestingly hot month for Netflix, and not only for the live-action stuff they´ll be offering. Their animation lineup is coming with some interesting titles, whether is American animation or anime. There are some titles which I linked to their trailers to check out a little about them

SEPTEMBER 7:

* [Stretch Armstrong &amp; the Flex Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNcmxhcKRuA&amp;t=4s) Season 2: The first season of this show was an enjoyable throwback of superhero animated shows of the 2000s with Victor Cook(Spectacular Spider-man, Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated), and even though it didn´t bring much new to the table, its last episode´s plot twist indicate that the series will stretch itself(get it?) to higher stakes for the protagonist trio. Wrongly accused for the attack on Rook Tower, the Flex Fighters must protect their city as wanted men. Will Charter City ever trust them again?
* Next Gen(a.k.a Robot 7723) - NETFLIX FILM: This movie marks Netflix's first deal at getting a movie from Cannes after losing out to Focus Features for the opening-night film, Everybody Knows. And as seen in the trailer, it seems the movie will mix the charm of Big Hero 6´s Hiro and Baymax´s relationship with some Wall-e thrown into the mix. A friendship with a top-secret robot turns a lonely girl's life into a thrilling adventure as they take on bullies, evil bots and a scheming madman.

SEPTEMBER 14:

* BoJack Horseman: Season 5: BoJack's back on screen as the star of ""Philbert,"" a new detective series produced by Princess Carolyn. But his demons are out in full force. Considering how the show has depicted Bojack´s depressive life and his many awful happenings and decisions, it seems there´ll be more obstacles for the poor douche horse to overcome if he wants to find some happiness in this new season.
* [LAST HOPE(a.k.a. Juushinki Pandora)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA5tTADNvGo): Shoji Kawamori(creator of the Macross franchise, or Robotech for overseas audiences) comes back with another anime series, this time one set in China, and that has some interesting robot designs, based on a mix of living thing with robotic. After causing the near extinction of mankind seven years ago, genius scientist Leon Lau must now fight the ecological disaster he unwittingly created. As a result, the global environment changed overnight. Living things (besides humans) and machines each underwent their own unique evolution, and the B.R.A.I. (Biological Revolutionary of Accelerated Intelligence) entities in particular evolved and came into being.
* [The Dragon Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HWcff0YEPM): Aaron Ehasz (head writer for Avatar: The Last Airbender), and video game director Justin Richmond (Uncharted) will take us to what we pressume it´ll be a PG version of Game of Thrones. And some review of its premiere at San Diego Comic-Con 2018 indicate that the series will feature a mix of light-hearted humor, detailed character development and world-building, and some epic action sequences. Two human princes forge an unlikely bond with the elven assassin sent to kill them, embarking on an epic quest to bring peace to their warring lands.
* Super Monsters Monster Party: Songs: Sing along and move to this groovy collection of music videos featuring monster friends Katya, Lobo, Zoe, Drac, Cleo and Frankie! For your little kids at home, this Super Monsters´ spin-off is a good change to make´em sing along and dance.

SEPTEMBER 21:

* [Dragon Pilot: Hisone &amp; Masotan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhq8oNxaqhI): This series marks the first time in years that Shinji Higuchi(writer of Neon Genesis Evangelion) has worked on an anime series, and it also has Mari Okada(director of the 2018 film Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms) as one of the writers. Recently stationed Air Self-Defense Force rookie Hisone Amakasu is chosen by a dragon concealed within Gifu Air Base to be his pilot. As seen on trailers, this´ll be How to Train Your Dragon if the dragons can also transform into airplanes, with an easily appealing artstyle and designs, along with an interesting self-discovery story for the whole family.
* Hilda: Based on the comic book of the same name, this series sounds like a good alternative to Gravity Falls, as the series features tons of mysterious creatures and a sense of wonder and exploration akin to a Hayao Miyazaki film. Join Hilda as she travels from a wilderness full of elves and giants to Trolberg, a bustling city packed with new friends and mysterious creatures.

SEPTEMBER 28:

* [Forest of Piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRVj2zFlpyM): There are not many anime series about playing classic music, so this series is a welcomed addition to the sub-genre list. Kai was born as the son of a prostitute and he's been playing the abandoned piano in the forest near his home ever since he was young. Shūhei, on the other hand, was practically breast-fed by the piano as the son of a family of prestigious pianists. Yet it is their common bond with the piano that eventually intertwines their paths in life. After Violet Evergarden, this sounds like an interesting character-driven drama to watch.
* [Lost Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ7Plvcpqi0): Continuing with music anime, we´ll have a story that follows Rin, an energetic girl who loves to eat and lives in a verdant frontier village, and songstress Finis, who despite living deep within the royal palace in the bustling capital city, spends her days in solitude. Both share a special power no other person has. A miraculous power that can heal wounds, create water and stir the wind: the power of song. From the trailers, the series is like a mix of Disney Princess movies from the past with war thrown in for good measure. Let´s hope it lives up to its premise.
* [Skylanders Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeMStkCW2LY): Season 3: Season 3 finds Spyro and the Skylanders forging unexpected alliances, taking on new adventures and even straddling the line between good and evil. The story seems intriguing right from the start, centering on the lovably arrogant Spyro, who's destined to become a hero but seems lacking in some important qualities for the job. Luckily he has his two best friends by his side, both of whom bring out the best in him even when he doesn't know it's there. He's also helped along by his eternally patient adoptive father and mentor, Master Eon in the battle against evil.",1

For example: Better Call Saul is a consistent and tightly-written show, but Mike's granddaughter acts and looks exactly the same as she did in Breaking Bad, which takes place years later. They probably should've cast a younger actress, because as it stands now, she's operating on cartoon-aging-logic in a universe that's fairly realistic.

1034,"Season 3 of 'Preacher' just concluded and the whole thing was very good. S1 and later parts of S2 very much had pacing issues, but now I am really glad to have stuck with it. This was all the stylized, surreal, violent fun that I ever hoped for. Ascended from B-Tier to A-Tier television.Three months ago I was not that excited when I saw that first new episode pop up in my watchlist. I was debating myself about if I should really do the weekly watch this time around again, rather than waiting and listening for reviews and potentially saving myself from a lot of disappointment. A few weeks later I was more excited about watching the next episode than about Better Call Saul even.

It already started out better than expected, although it had me worried about the characters kinda being stuck at a place again with one or two baddies with a hint of menacing mystery... not again please. I think it was around episode 4 that I suddenly had this feeling of ""Am I really watching the same show still? This is on an entirely new level!"".

The direction was suddenly amazing, the protagonists suddenly had great plot lines, with goals and challenges which are really about who they are, then progressing, but true to their personality. And on top of that we CONSTANTLY get new rich crazy ideas and characters introduced. We go from SOFT SPOILER voodoo fight club, to druggy vampire diaries, to biblical john wick, all the while the worlds' and non-worlds' most powerful figures are getting involved in the games.

Last night's finale is seeing praise from fans, and I agree that it had good action and real satisfying conclusions to the plot lines, but from this season even this does not stand out to me as much as the large middle chunk of extremely well directed, well paced, colorful episodes that were really about the characters.",1

I was skeptical in the early seasons that they would be able to continue what they were doing and keep it fresh for many seasons, but they manage to keep ratcheting up the stakes and tension without becoming redundant. Particularly the two leads have done some of the best work I've seen done on television. The scene with Elizabeth and the young state dept. intern in the car just gave me chills. I really hope they sweep the awards this year because they deserve it.",1

I was thinking this afternoon about how I'd watch The Office to deal with stress when I was in college and living at home and feeling stuck. The show ended and I moved out for grad school and New Girl became my go-to as I dealt with an insane supervisor. As I started working, Brooklyn 99/Superstore started and then The Good Place popped up for me recently (I guess I might die soon?).   
On top of this, of course, I watched shows like Parks and Rec, 30 Rock, Bob's Burgers, HIMYM, IASIP, The West Wing, Gilmore Girls - they all feel like a warm hug. 

So, what are your shows? What makes you happy?

1055,"Issues with Luke Cage S02Spoilers ahead for the ending of S02 of Luke Cage, if you plan on watching it don't read on.

​

\[Spoiler\](#s ""So I just finished season 2 of Luke Cage and it left a horrid taste in my mouth. First off the season itself was pretty terrible but the ending just really got me twisted.

So after the lawyer reads off Mariah's will, Luke clearly says ""nah"" when asked if he'd like to receive Harlem's Paradise. In fact he specifically says ""Nah, burn it down, burn it all to the ground"". Yet in the very next scene, he's taken over the club. No explanation on why he said no. He explains why he took it but not why he said no. They could have literally just had it cut to the next scene with him not answering but saying out right no, and then doing it?

​

It for me capped off what was just a really poor showing. I'm trying to stay hopeful for S03 but with how it appears to be going (relationship drama, Luke possibly turning into the bad guy, and Mariah's daughter randomly becoming the new villain because she didn't get the club?) it just seems it's going further down a rabbit hole that it can't dig itself out of."")

​

I'd love to hear what everyone else thinks, and maybe if someone can tell me if I missed something which is causing my confusion.",1

1068,"Sex scenes every where, what do they add?Before I decided to type this, I googled the topic to get an idea of where people come from but I want a more substantial answer.

Sex is extremely normal to see in tv shows and movies, I would say nowa days but lets be honest its been ramping up for awhile now.

I have to admit, my opinion on sex scenes has remained consistent from when I was a child up until now (late 20's). I get it, sex is just like the greatest marvel of all humankind. Yeah, except fucking not lol. Like no one is going to argue sex doesn't feel good but do we REALLY need to see those awkward 15-30 second scenes? First off, who is looking forward to those scenes? What could that possibly do for any individual, and if it does satisfy some individual I'm prepared to throw around some judgment. As if ""oh I didn't really understood how John felt about Jane until I saw 30 seconds of awkward camera angles hiding genitalia."" Like who watches those scenes and says ""Fuck yeah, this is what i've been waiting for."" If so why aren't you just watching a porno. I just find it extremely hard to relate to that line of thinking and yeah i think it's a bit off. I hear sex gets higher ratings but... how? Like as in a show wouldn't have been as good without the awkward sex scenes? Lol who are we adding into the viewership at this point? At the core of this, I really feel people fall into two categories. People that sigh every time they see sex on a show, and everyone else. I know we are re-doing the hippie era. Everyone has sex with everyone, yay sexual liberty. Let's sexualize everything because sex is the epitome of greatness. I do wish we didn't need to pander to sensually indulgent peasants that cant find meaning to life outside sex. Again I'm not a prude, sex is fine but there is a reason why people in my life time are going to be marrying themselves to sexbots, must we cater to weirdos? I'm not religious. I don't think sex is evil, I just can't say that any particular sex scene has done anything for me what so ever. So feel free to disagree, but use words and phrases to tell me how I'm wrong. Explain to me how it makes ANY show better, and if you DO enjoy them please... entertain me with why that is.

The most appropriate way I've seen it handled is when it's suggested that these two people are going to have sex and then it cuts away. Like what else do I need to see to understand? ",1

1071,"The Show 'Drop the Mic' would be 100% better if it followed the format of 'Dancing with the Star.' Hear me out...Drop the Mic is just a terrible show. I only watched it because it was after Wrecked (which is a very funny show.) Why am I watching celebrities rehearse pre-written lines? This show is barely youtube worthy. Why was this even made a show?

A better format for the show is if it followed DWTS. If every week, they paired a celebrity with a legit rapper (akin to DWTS and how every celeb is paired with a professional dancer.) 


Every week the celebrity is paired up with his or her rapper and they have to come up with a diss track. Half the show follows each respective team and the creative process, giving the audience a look at how each rapper works and just how difficult it is to come up with a diss track. Maybe we see like how intense Ice T is and how professional he is. Maybe we see that Snoop Dogg doesn't smoke when he writes (lol.) It would be really cool to see up and coming rappers as well go up against more established guys. Imagine seeing some Drake beef play out on here as well


The other half of the show is them actually performing the rap. It is best out of 3. There are also 'breaks' to allow for any last minute rewrites.


Basically, the show would be a PG version of '8 Mile' with celebrities. 


Not a great show, but a far more interesting one than the shit Hailey Baldwin is presenting.",1

Unfortunately from the reviews it seems like the quality takes a nosedive and decreases massively in the following seasons, as well as Donald Glover leaving the show.

They were telegraphing early on in the season that Amma was serious disturbed. I kept waiting for the reveal all season and think they did it such a fun twisted way but was anyone actually shocked by the ending? I don’t mean to criticize the stellar show at all but I saw that coming as soon as they kept filming Amma in the first episodes with the lingering shots and her lingering looks. Honestly this show wasn’t about the story anyways it was about the jaw dropping acting chops of the three female leads. 

But anyways, I had no one to talk to about this while it was airing so, did anyone else see that ending coming since early in the season or am I just a regular detective popcorn over here?",1

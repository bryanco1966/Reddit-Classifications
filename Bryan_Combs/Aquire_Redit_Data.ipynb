Putting that aside, it is time to look at reality. If democrats do not win back the house and/or the senate in this election, we will face another two years of our democracy being shredded by an inept and callous Trump administration.

It is imperative that we put aside our differences for the time being and stop fighting with each other. We all know who the real threat to our democracy is.

We all understand. Many Progressives feel unwelcome and belittled. Many Centrists feel like they are consistently under attack. If you feel like your fellow Democrats who are of an alternative viewpoint are not respecting you, remember they likely feel the same way. Empathy is an important trait to have right now. It is something we have over the Republican Party; it is something we need to utilize—not only to defeat them but to work together. We, as a party, must be able to combine our efforts if we are to achieve any of our goals. Perhaps it is ironic that the man who said it best was a Republican himself, Abraham Lincoln: \"A house divided against itself, cannot stand.\"\\n\\nWe may not ever all completely agree, but that is what makes us great. That is what makes us strong and resilient! As many have often said: we are a \"big tent party.\" We can disagree; we can like different politicians; we can debate about the issues. However, we cannot waver: **Not now!** \\n\\n**THE PRIMARIES ARE NOW OVER.** Progressives and Centrists both had significant victories in the primaries this year, and it is becoming increasingly evident that both sides have a place in the Democratic Party.

We\\'ve all decided that the Republican Party is dangerous!
